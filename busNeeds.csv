"We had some staff augmentation contractors onsite doing some of the work. We were coming up on our internal limit that we had for co-employment. We need to find a solution to either transition some of these resources or transition the work."
"We had software in place for our apps, such as Document, which was quite old and we needed to renew. We did a tender on the open market to see who could deliver this type of software. We invited five companies. One of them was HP, but HP didnt offer their own product. Instead they offered Open Text. It is not their product, but they are the prime contractor for the software, licenses, and the service. Also, HP was only involved in fulfilling the service and support but not in the migration or in the software itself. That was the setup they offered us. The problem was to renew the existing, archaic solution. It was the main purpose of the tender."
"Its more level setting on the organization piece. We had some organizational changes go on starting at the beginning of the year and through probably about two months ago. I now have a new role. When I was leading this particular RFP, I was the director over our enterprise data warehouse and business intelligence. I had a different role than I have today. I can still answer all the questions because I was the one leading the effort. This RFP effort was actually sent out last fall.[return]     The business driver for it was the fact that the enterprise data and business intelligence group was an enterprise group[emdash]meaning that we supported data and reporting needs for all organizations across Southwest, which is a large scope[emdash]and we constantly have high priority demand coming at us from every angle. What we sought to do was try to have it where we packaged together all of the small enhancements, break-fix things, and small projects into a separate engagement where we had a managed services partner run herd over all of that. Then we would have it where most of the Southwest employees focused on a lot of the strategic initiatives. It was more of a strategic move from the way that we structure ourselves to be more effective; to provide more focus on strategic initiatives."
"Previously answered. [Within this project, we issued a request for proposal to some companies. HP was one of these companies. [return]     ...The change program is focused in Belgium. It is about a 200-million-plus-a-year investment program for the next four or five years in the distribution channels for bank and insurance. Within that, with that respect, we are interested to know more about our customers: what of account they today identify as big data analysis and customer insights. I am responsible for a group of people who are calculating a preference or looking for a forecast with respect to a propensity to buy.[return]      With respect to that, we issued an RFP to some companies to look for a solution that can help us better create more customer insights and, based on these, bring these customer insights into valuable leads and offer these leads to the direct channels. That, in a nutshell, is the project.]"
"We had IM&A, ACA, plus DPT support already with Accenture for many years. Thats not a secret for Accenture nor HP. We were moderately satisfied with Accenture. When we decided to invest in a second stream of programs with HP[emdash]we had eDiscovery with HP; then a year ago, we decided to invest also in IDOL and ControlPoint to do other things which are not in eDiscovery[emdash]at that time, we said, We are growing in this phase, so wouldnt it make sense to shut down operations with Accenture and bring it all to HP, combined? Because theyre different processes, but the technology is the same. That was our business case. So we took it away from Accenture, basically."
"First, an outbound centralization system, as mentioned. The need was to create just one support system in outbound to connect all the call centers which SKY uses to promote all its products.[return][return]What were the business needs for  the customer systems purchase? [return]The need was to create just one customers touch-point system, to know immediately when a customer contacts us[emdash]by mail, by phone, by post, by fax[emdash]and to be able to know immediately what that user used, what he bought, which services he is using, what we have already offered to him, how many times he has already called, if this is someone that pays regularly or not, and if he has ever mentioned the possibility of leaving SKY or changing services that he is using. This was the need."
"We were looking to implement a tower house-cum-business intelligence piece for one of our customers, and we were asked to do the vendor evaluation as well as the subsequent implementation. Thats how we started with the whole evaluation process."
"I think FETnet is our portal to allow our customers who are mobile users to access and to understand what kind of product we provide. We also provide some kinds of Web services for them to query their monthly bill; and also it is a place for us to provide our content services. We had this portal developed probably 10 years ago. Now is the time for us to reconfigure due to the recent changes, because the Internet services are more public through the pad and also even through the smartphone, although we do have some past smartphone solutions[emdash]so basically, three different kinds of platforms. We learn that for current or more advanced technology, we should have the ability to provide all those three different kinds of devices through one content management. This is one of the reasons that we try to understand the software capability and see what we can get from there."
"Let me give you some background. Prior to GE signing a larger agreement with HP, we had previously been an IBM Global Services customer. That was for our mainframe services. For our Logical DBA support, we had contracted that through a different provider. Previously it was a company called Tiburon, and Tiburon was acquired by EMC. So June 30 of 2014, IBM was doing mainframe services and EMC was doing our Logical DBA. On July 1, HP became our new service provider for mainframe services, and we continued with EMC. At that time, I spoke with my counterpart in HP about the possibility of HP looking to see if they could take on the Logical DBA work. They were interested, but the timing wasnt right for either of us because we were heavily focused on transitioning from IBM to HP, and then we also had to go through what was called a transformation; which was really a big, fancy word for saying we were going to migrate our work that sat in Alpharetta, Georgia to HPs data center in Plano, Texas.[return]     After we got into the first of this year[emdash]probably in the March time frame[emdash]I circled back with my counterpart at HP and said, Id really like you all to come back and take a look at the agreement and see if you could provide the service. What I was looking to get, specifically, by talking to HP was two things. First, I wanted to see if they could be cost effective or cost competitive against EMC. Second[emdash]which I think was the biggest appealing factor to GE[emdash]was that we could eliminate a vendor. Its not that EMC had been a bad vendor[emdash]they werent[emdash]but its the fact that I could basically come to one person if I had any issues and have everything managed by HP, versus if I have some set of problems I go to HP and if I have another set of problems Im going to EMC. I really liked and wanted to try to simplify our vendor mix. Seeing if HP could be a possible fit for us was a logical thing for us to do, so we gave HP a requirements and scope document, and they came back with a scope of work. We refined that with them and were ultimately able to go ahead and execute the agreement with HP and terminated our service with EMC."
"We needed a deep solution for storing a really huge amount of the data[emdash]because this is over 100 terabytes of data[emdash]with the functionality for making an ad hoc analysis preparation of some statistical information and aggregation, and also for very fast interface for looking for the particular records in this database."
"They offered me the possibility for them to help manage the nonproductive environment for me. It is not exactly development, but it is to do the sanity checks and implement some of what we call SCRs, which are change requests, on top of a nonproductive environment for our projects.[return][return]What were your thoughts on what HP was proposing?[return]HP did our operation for a long time, and they also do our AMS support. They are inside the company, so they know a lot about our struggles and pains. HP could see that I was suffering in the delivery of a specific service to my customer. On this point, my customer is the project area where I provide for them a nonproductive environment for them to develop tests and do quality. What basically they told me is that they could provide me the creation, support, and maintenance of this environment."
"What made you realize, We need to re-engineer this?[return]Yes, thats clear. We are speaking about an application developed for Iveco. Iveco is a company inside CNH in the 90s, so its quite an old application. It was developed on a specific request, so its a completely customized application. In the last year, we had some problems in the obsoletions of this application because its not an out-of-the-box application. Theres not a lot of evolution related to the vendor that decided to release every year, some new release of the product, and requested some engineers from a technology point of view. It was a problem that we had around 2010.[return]     At that moment we evaluated two possibilities. The first possibility was to re-engineer the current application from a technological point of view. A second possibility was to evaluate the possibility to get some out-of-the-box application present on the market, and to move the current application to the new one[emdash]so moving from a custom application to an out-of-the-box application. It was around 2010 when we had the two possibilities to evaluate. Of course at first, it was preferred to continue the relationship with the current provider, who was HP. The second alternative was to verify an application on the market. In this, we patiently tried to evaluate the application that we already used for other processes in CNH Industrial that was provided by Siemens, so the possibility to extend the application provided by Siemens also for the processes covered by our custom application, as well as the current."
"We are starting up a life insurance operation, and for that, we required a proper policy admin system.[return][return]So you needed to purchase new services.[return]Absolutely."
"These services had been provided for five years from the current provider, and our contract was near the end. We decided in the middle of last year to begin an RFP process to consult the market. In order to do this, we developed a technical specification. We had many visits to many providers. We invited many of them to present to us. Among all of them, HP was one of the companies selected that we think could provide these services for us."
"At the start of the project, we had a long discussion with John Pionet about a commercial application. We have, during this period of time, been thinking of using a different solution or different approach, which is why we did not develop it internally[emdash]using a local supplier we identified to deliver faster and closer to us for services, not just application development for services, and so on. The idea was to give an opportunity to HP to develop due to competence on that project, and with a low level of risk in renewing the application for CNH Industrial."
"Senior Test Consultant: We were currently operating a resourcing model in testing where we had a panel of providers that we would seek specialized resources from. The intention of this RFP was to partner with one sole provider to fulfill those needs, but also to bring some expertise to the table to help us develop our testing services with Inland Revenue itself."
"We have a contract for outsourcing with IBM which has been running for almost 10 years and finishes next December 31[emdash]the end of this year[emdash]and it needs to be replaced, of course. Thats what prompted the process.[return][return]There were four specific areas where you were asking for bids and HP bid on three of them, correct?[return]Exactly. Yes.[return][return]<i>Additional comment in writing: </i>Full outsourcing of all infrastructure management and operation."
"The purchase was because we were transitioning away from Cobb EMC managing our CIS system, and all the applications, development, and support for it. We transitioned. We are looking for an outsourcer to manage that for us."
"We are a public administration, and we have a lot of external contracts. Part of these external contracts are covering two different teams, so we have two really large teams. One of the teams is in charge of development of software. We are trying to make it more efficient. Thats the reason behind it."
"There were two. One was the fact that the contract Amgen and HP were working under was coming to a close in December 2013, which required us to bid it. Secondly, as we looked at how we had operated under that deal previously, it was not written as broadly as we needed it to be. Over the five years of that deal, we had changed some things, and so when we sourced the deal, we actually sourced a little over 600 applications for support. However, in the deal that HP and Amgen were under at that point, only about 350 of them were under contract. There were a fair number that were outside that deal. Besides the support, there was also a development piece, and we were cleaving the development piece into a different part of the work stream. We didnt believe that those were two that needed to be intimately involved with each other."
"It was a business need. We are a global company, and we have presence in Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America, Latin America, and South America. However, we were managing our SAP support very differently. We wanted to harmonize our SAP support processes. It was more about finding the efficiency in the operation as well as the cost."
"We had an old contract that was in place with old methodologies that had been used that seemed to be costing us too much money. We werent necessarily getting the best service that we thought could potentially be in the market; especially when we looked at some of our competitors and how they were doing business. Also, we had a number of different SAP modules that were supported by different partners. So first of all, could we get the service improved? Could we receive the service cheaper? Would it be possible to have simplification with one vendor managing it end-to-end for us? Those were the questions we were asking when we first went out to RFI.[return][return]Who was the provider orignally?[return]The predominant provider was IBM. We do have other providers providing some of the smaller components, but the main player with the majority of the spend was IBM.[return][return]Did you end up consolidating all of that in with HP then? Was that successful?[return]We did except for two areas. The first one that got released before we went to RFP was security. Thats still sitting with Deloitte at the moment and will continue to for at least another year. Then at that point, we will consider whether we can move that across to HP. That was an internal decision that was made after a new agreement with Deloitte was put in place.[return]     The second element was B2B. We decided we would keep that with the incumbent, which is Infasys, simply because the level of expertise that came through from HP at the time didnt provide enough comfort for such a core component of the business to transition across. That was the only element that sat. The other four, which were development factory, IMS, ISYS, and global master data[emdash]all four of those got moved. Predominately we managed to consolidate, which was great."
"These services had been provided for five years from the current provider, and our contract was near the end. We decided in the middle of last year to begin an RFP process to consult the market. In order to do this, we developed a technical specification. We had many visits to many providers. We invited many of them to present to us. Among all of them, HP was one of the companies selected that we think could provide these services for us."
"The primary prompting was that our contract was terminating. In other words, it was up for at least a renewal. Beyond that, there were some things in terms of our operating model and strategy since the time the original deal, including a change in CIO and other key players. That led to some new ideas about what the future might look like in terms of what we were going to need there. It also led to some recognition that the road ahead looked different from the past, so that might warrant a different kind of partnership. There was generally some belief that financially there might be some advantage. Finally, the performance to date, although not horrendous, hasnt quite been extraordinary either, and maybe there could be more outside from a service delivery perspective."
"Two things. First, we were thinking after many years with our incumbent vendor, we would have significant cost saving opportunities. Second, as the service industry has evolved, we were looking for a new delivery model. We are looking for support leadership and client driven service. In particular, we wanted to drive a more business outcome driven service than just a technology service."
"It wasnt business needs per se. We were basically outsourcing our whole support team to a third-party vendor. I guess the business needs or the benefits would be cost reduction, 24/7 support, and the ability to support on a global basis.[return][return]So it had been an ongoing strategy you were tackling in your discussions, and 2014 was determined to be the year you wanted to implement that. Is that correct?[return]That is a good guess."
"There are really two things. We had realized that we werent being fair to Hewlett-Packard or to ourselves in the model that we had set up with them. To say we want HP to make supporting this application cheaper and cheaper and cheaper[emdash]which is what any company always says[emdash]and then say to them, We think we need you to keep three people on it. Thats impossible. How can they say to me, Look, here are the outcomes I expect in terms of incident closure rates, or problem solutions so there are fewer incidents[emdash]those kinds of things[emdash]and not get hung up on, frankly, If you need to do that with 1,000 people or one thousandth of a person, that shouldnt matter to me except that it works and Im paying no more than I must. We were approaching that from the other model. That didnt serve us well, and I dont think it served HP well. As a conclusion of that[emdash]and the marketplace had moved in this direction a lot more[emdash]based on where the marketplace was moving we said, Lets change and move to what the market is doing today, which is on much more of an outcomes basis."
"In this particular bid, IT decided to outsource Support Level 4. That was the intention on this one.[return][return]Is this a new outsourcing, or is it a rebid?[return]Its brand new. The bid is new."
"We were looking for a company to work with us in developing ABAP and .NET. It was just this. We didnt have any particular reason. It is because we had another company that was doing this task for us, and the contract was almost over so we decided to find another company to support us in developing for us."
"The business need was the Genesys suite of products, which is an enterprise software product we use to effectively route work from a client contact perspective through a range of different channels. We route that work to a broader workforce inside the ATO. Its an effective client relationship workforce routing piece of software that we bought. It needs to sit onto underlying infrastructure to allow that to work. We required an organization that could build that infrastructure consistent with where Genesys was going in terms of their software, and also provide an ongoing support capability for that product once it goes into production.[return]     The business driver is really around an increased level of operational efficiency. Thats the main thing. There is a clear business need that we need to achieve out of the implementation of the Genesys suite of products, which is called IWD. The infrastructure is the behind-the-scenes capability that software needs to sit on. Of course, enterprise applications and infrastructure go hand in hand. Infrastructure is kind of the unsung hero. Its like you want to watch television, but you need power. It is that kind of model."
"The installment of the new government has led to a revision in public sector services and efficiencies. Through that, obviously there has been an increased drive in looking at how an outsource could provide those services. There has also been a drive to reduce numbers through natural attrtion and voluntary redundancies. Alongside that, there is still a drive from the government to deliver on legislative services that have been passed down from our Parliament.[return]     Coupled with that, there are these other efficiencies the department is looking at in regards to using technology to further realize those efficiencies. RWD will give the department the opportunity to provide greater customer service in terms of targeting the specific subject matter expert in a call center for a particular case thats coming through the IVR system. What led us to going down this path was primarily a dip your toe into the water to establish where the service provider could actually provide an application support capability or model on any business line call[emdash]still within EST but called enterprise applications. The primary role of Enterprise applications is the management, development, testing, etcetera, of applications within the organization. It was about saying, Enterprise applications through staff restraints isnt allowed to grow, but we still need a capability to support this particular product.[return][return]Which is Genesys right?[return]Yes, Genesys is one component of it. I think that the component I was most focused on was the IWD component within that whole Genesys suite. The Genesys product has tentacles with our other service provider, Optus or SynTel. There are complexities in working arrangements between the various vendors where the ATO was a client. However, for this particular engagement, my focus was primarily around how HP as a service provider would integrate with the ATO in terms of policy, procedure, etcetera, in mimicking the enterprise application team.[return]"
"We have various call centers, and there are obviously business groups who deal with the public here. The system were putting in is called Integrated Workforce Distribution which is a Genesys application. Were using that tool to route calls to the various groups of people who are able to respond to those calls. Thats an application where you can build processes and systems into the application, and it highlights a particular area where a call or piece of work can be routed to, so its effectively a work management or work routing tool. It was a way of improving business efficiency. That was the business need: to get this tool or this application in place."
"The business needs were a new industry compliant ticketing system and a new industry compliant EMD system. EMD means electronic miscellaneous documents."
"We have an aging 30- or 40-year-old COBOL-based claims adjudication system, like a lot like a lot of people in the industry have. We were looking at ways of replacing it. We generally do our own development here, so we were looking at rewriting it in-house. It was going to be a 5- to 10-year project probably, which generally doesnt work out very well for us. We ended up partnering with the province of Manitoba. We are building this system for ourselves and the province of Manitoba and sharing the cost of development. I think normally we wouldnt have picked SAP as a solution, but the province is a big SAP shop and we got to share the costs. That was the reason we did an SAP implementation."
"To be honest, we have been outsourcing for the last 50 years. Its just a continuation of our strategy of trying to outsource as much as possible and redirect our internal IT resources to the more, I would say, added value chain of things. We outsource all the commodity aspects and all the operations aspects."
"We had a large acquisition. Whenever we have large mergers and acquisitions, we always go through a consolidation and business case integration process. Thats what this was part of. The business we bought had an AO provider and so did we. We dont want two."
"We have a big pipeline of bespoke software development both for the Ministry and for the Health Center. Good experienced software test resources are in short supply. I think thats probably a global problem. Particularly with the Ministry needing to be able to peak and trough and be responsive to different stages of the software development life cycle for these projects, we must be able to respond quickly with the right mix of quality testers for functional and nonfunctional testing.[return]     Having a large team of permanent configuration of testers isnt flexible and is not going to fit our software development pipeline as well as a software test partner. The way we are going forward is to have a small permanent team of software testers and a testing services manager, but we are going to supplement that with a panel. Therefore we can pick and get the best mix of testers for specific projects, and we can ramp up quickly and then ramp down. Its a much more flexible model."
"Actually, I was called in 2012 by the CEO of Swiss to move the service to Amadeus. I had moved Royal Jordanian Airlines from SITA to Amadeus. I therefore had some experience, and he wanted me to come back to Swiss. I was Chief Commercial Officer of Royal Jordanian Airlines for eight years, and before that I was a Swiss SVP. So he knew me quite well and he asked me to come back.[return]     I then started to go to the management board and to the board of directors to tell them, I dont just want to move to Amadeus. I would like to look whether it is possible to remain with HP, or if we should move to Amadeus. Then I opened up the evaluation between the two companies after having received acceptance from the board of directors to look at both.[return][return]You didnt include anyone else besides Amadeus and HP, correct?[return]No. The reason is because Lufthansa and Ocean are already running on Amadeus. We are also owned by Lufthansa. Brussels Airlines is owned 45 percent by Lufthansa, and they might move up to own 100 percent of Brussels airlines. So from Lufthansa, there was a very big push for us to move onto the same systems for signature reasons. That was the main reason why, and the push was very, very strong."
"As an IT organization from a business as usual IT operations perspective, were predominantly outsourced. So, we have had existing relationships with HP for both overall IT infrastructure management services and IT application management services. In 2012, we actually made an acquisition, and we purchased a company that operates in a number of central European countries. So, the prompt was the need to integrate that acquisition into our overall infrastructure and services.[return]     Obviously, that company had outsourcing arrangements with other companies, so what we needed to do was move to a single provider for those services across the globe. So, the trigger was, really, the integration of that acquisition in central Europe. We looked at a number of providers from an infrastructure perspective, but this specific activity was around application management and support, so we looked for a single provider to provide application services to Molson Coors that encompassed the Molson Coors legacy, which was already with HP from an application management perspective. It was to look to integrate central Europe, which had a different application services or application support provider."
"The business need is identified by the UK government, specifically the Department for Work and Pensions, which is one of the big government departments here. They are keen to see a sustainable credit union sector in the UK. That means making a level of investment in a strategic change program that will allow the credit unions to be sustainable and to grow in a manner that they havent been able to up until this point, and for them to no longer rely on funding from the government; i.e. to be self sustaining. That set up the goals and objectives for the project which ABCUL tendered for, selected a vendor, and then set up a project team to deliver."
"The reason that drove it was we had done an M&A. We had another company that was providing services for that group that we purchased and we needed to consolidate services and wanted to drive synergies."
"In this particular case, we have the BW migration on HANA. Because of the new technology and different approaches to this type of implementation, we decided to explore what options are in the market. We went through an RFP process of inviting vendors and asking them, How would you do it? What assumptions? What cost? What considerations? HP was part of that process."
"There was a need for a new system because our current system is old and antiquated."
"There are two elements. One, its currently an insourced service; and we were looking to transform our internal organization to be more responsive to our end customer, at the end of the day. When we did some initial analysis on what we, potentially, could do and what the market was offering, it really highlighted that the market is very mature in this space. Were somewhat behind the curve, so the decision was made that an outsourced solution would be the optimum outcome for this area of the business."
"We have a system which is about 15 years old, so the technological platform is very old. We have to renew the system."
"JDC is a nonprofit organization. It is celebrating this year its hundredth birthday. Primarily it has grown in Israel the last 20 years. It started working in Israel many years ago, but the main growth was in the last 20 years. Thats in parallel in activity all over the world. Our headquarters is in New York, but we have activities in many countries and many offices around the world.[return]     From an IT perspective, each country or office grew separately, so we dont have a centralized backbone of applications, services, and IT infrastructure. We have IT solutions in New York. We have separate in Israel. We have a few separate solutions in the former Soviet Union. Specifically when we talk about ERP, in terms of finance and budgeting, we also have many many solutions and applications. Some of them are products. Some of them are self-developments. The main issue was to create one ERP system to manage our budget and finance."
"Procurement: First of all, it was to improve quality of SAP-related services.[return][return]SAP Lead: To have an in-house department taking care of applications and maintenance activities and the opportunity for the quality of that[emdash]for instance, by having 70 percent in-support instead of only offshore. That was our key driver."
"They have a mostly homegrown system. I think they bought a skeleton package back in the late 80s. Their line of business system in the industry is called a pension administration system solution, or PAS. A lot of people just call it a PAS. Think of this as a customized human resource information system. It does payroll in the same way the HR payroll package does, but the component which is heavily customized is the retiree pension calculation portion of it. These systems collect contributions, salary, and employment data over the course of someones career. This could be 30 or 40 years. Then, they run calculation routines to figure out the monthly benefit and output that benefit into a monthly check. These systems are not replaced a lot. There arent a lot of software vendors in this space who do this kind of work, and these organizations tend to hold onto them for a long time.[return]     The University of California system is approximately 25 years old. Its an IBM mainframe solution that has basically just reached the end. They customized it and added bolt-on modules as much as they possibly could. They really cant customize it anymore. I think the universitys technology department wants to move off the mainframe and get all the applications off; not just the retirement department, but all of them. Its just a mainframe conversion project."
"In early 2013 we conducted quite a large process mapping exercise across our team, and that highlighted a number of areas of improvement that drove quite a lot of initiatives. One of those strategic ones was the need to have better management of our transport. That started off the journey soon after to work with our globalization to say, What do we use globally for transport management? What would be applicable for any specific region? and we started talking to the vendors informally.[return]     Then I guess it slowly narrowed itself down to a decision of either OTM or SAP in terms of solutions for transport, and then it progressed from there to a formal RFP; and thats when HP, SAP, IBM, and Eminent were first formally involved in the process. However, we had been talking with both IBM, SAP, and HP previously at a global and regional level informally before that."
"COO: We have a system that was in place. It was first implemented in 2000, so it is relatively old. Its AS/400 based and not necessarily meeting the requirements and the needs of the county any longer. All of the justice partners decided that it was time to look at an integrated system. Some of them still dont have a system that they use today, so we have a lot of other systems and programs being run to meet the needs of the office. It was time to save a little bit in resources[emdash]hopefully money long term[emdash]and get something that is going to take us into the future compared to where we are today."
"Are you talking about the SAP outsourcing?[return][return]Yes; only about that.[return]Okay, because we have another engagement which is a global IT outsourcing.[return][return]Is that a new one thats coming up, or is it also one that youve just recently decided?[return]We just recently signed the SAP, but the global outsourcing is currently in progress, so its another project.[return][return]Specific to the SAP project, tell me what prompted this in the first place. [return]We  have various finance systems. As a group, we want to standardize our  finance system with SAP, so we have been advised by PwC, after a finders fee process, to select SAP. The project has been run by PwC. So we have signed  for SAP. We had the choice either  to run SAP internally or to outsource the run. We decided to do a  finders fee and to give the run of SAP to HP. We did that  because we have another engagement with HP, which is global IT outsourcing, so its a little bit consistent with our strategy.[return][return]I think that decision was made a few months ago, if I remember.[return]Yes.[return][return]Specific  to this, it sounds like you did RFI and RFP. Who  would you say was the next closest vendor to HP in your evaluation  process for the SAP?[return]It was Infosys."
"Procurement Director: The Romanian Bank, Banca Comerciala Romana, is doing the entire cash management, cash processing, meaning we collect the cash from our retail customers and from the branches.[return][return]Sourcing Manager: From ATMs.[return][return]Procurement Director: From ATMs, from cash machines. We process them in huge cash processing centers, meaning we count them, clean them, and sort them. Then we distribute them back into the liquidity and back into the market[emdash]back into ATMs, shops, retail branches, and so on. For that, we need a software which helps us optimize the cash reserves and the cash provisions in the ATMs, in the branches, and so on, and to forecast how much cash we will need where and when. We need a software to optimize all of those cash logistics."
"Basically, Glasgow City Council has a very large SAS estate, and it was currently sitting on some Solaris hardware, which was purchased around 2006 or 2007. It was absolutely at capacity. It could no longer be supported. That was running our business-critical applications, so that was a situation which we could not let go on. We decided that we had to go out and buy a whole suite of new hardware to sit on. At the time, it was decided that there would also be efficiencies by moving in the database application from Oracle to ASE and at the same time implementing HANA, which was something we had been looking at for a while to improve the reporting performance. We made that decision to move before the hardware completely dropped down and we received no service, which would not have been good."
"We hired HP to provide system maintenance service for our credit card customers.[return][return]Do you look at other vendors every time you have a renewal?[return]Yes, we will always evaluate the vendors services and decide whether to renew with them ahead of time, well before the contract expiration date. Our company will always do evaluation on several vendors."
"We need to migrate from our very old Oracle system to SAP; this is the direction from the group, so we need to do that. HP is a group direction.[return][return]Why did the group decide that they needed to do this now?[return]They have been talking about doing this for a while."
"We had implemented Workday as our global HR solution; and as part of the implementation, wed signed a steady statement of work for 90 days with the implementation partner, but we were looking for a midterm solution. Ill say midterm[emdash]we didnt want to lock too deep because Workday is so new in the HR technology space. Our goal was to find an application maintenance provider who could do business as usual and application support on the Workday application for a two-year managed services contract."
"We have an application Workday that was implemented; and from there, we needed to make sure that we had a third party who could handle the production maintenance and support."
"We were part of the combined company Del Monte Corporation, and the company split in two last February. The financing, accounting, and IT were shared services; and as part of that, they went with the other company, which is the Big Heart Pet Brands organization. Were under our transitional services agreement, and we need to stand up a new IT and finance and accounting functions."
"Bandhan Financial Services has been approved by RDI to become a bank. It got, in principle, approval for a banking license in spring of 2014. We have 18 months to open our first bank branch. Right now, we dont have banking software and such. Right now, we are in that planning company, and we have in-house developed software. What we need to become a bank is a full IT automation using core banking solutions and other central applications that are required to run a bank. The entire objective for this vendor selection process is to find a single vendor who can manage a routine for us, because we dont have a big IT department; we have a small IT department. We quoted a request for proposal, and we got responses from three or four vendors who have actually done this kind of project. We required a core banking solution plus several other applications, such as a check translation system, risk management software in treasury and trade finance, anti-money laundering, asset liability management, financial inclusions[emdash]there are several other applications that we required for the banking transformation. In addition, we also required someone to prepare the data center, as well as the data recovery centers. Thats why we prepared this RFP to take care of all this. Eventually we will absorb a price for this transformation."
"IT HR Manager: We decided that we wanted to change the assistance provider for the SAP HR services. We wanted to try a new provider, both to see what was out there and to see, if we put it out for bid, if we could save a little bit as well."
"Currently we are supporting this particular application, or this environment, with two contractors. The model we were trying to move from (and both those contractors were in North America either at our headquarters or working remotely) and those resources were fairly expensive, and you can probably imagine the hours of coverage were not necessarily what we would have liked. So really the intent was to move to more of a sustainable model, a managed service type of engagement where we would be paying for SLAs and having access to things in the contract of that nature that would allow us to grow. This particular environment and application weve seen, [we] are forecasting significant growth over the coming years, and we needed to be proactive and change the model as a result of that."
"The company was sold and was actually acquired; and the acquiring company did not have the infrastructure to support the new acquisition. So we negotiated a transition services agreement with our previous parent; and they provided back office, IT, and accounting support for a period of one year. What we needed to do is find a partner who could help us with the transition and transformation, as well as long-term managed services."
"The goal was having an app for customers with the special focus of sending postcards worldwide. We want to develop an app where you can send worldwide e-postcards by making pictures there and sending it to receive postcards within two days, for example. That was the special project we are talking about."
"We had contractors providing support for one of our application platforms, and we were looking for more of a long-term solution."
"Weve been working with HP, and before that, with EDS, for a long time now[emdash]more than 10 years[emdash]on just internal control proposals. We needed to make an RFP to renew our contracts on this kind of services just because its normal to make an RFP for this kind of contract[emdash]for these amounts, I would say."
"We had had a very challenging launch of SAP, which is an ERP system,  back in 2012. The company was struggling with the system not performing  as expected and business performance being under what it was  pre-implementation. So we were looking to work with a partner who could  unravel technically, and from a business process perspective, unravel  what had occurred and try to give us some guidance on how to improve the  situation.[return][return]So kind of some analytics and management of that, it sounds like,  correct? [return]Yes, correct, and a lot of business process but also technical."
"Previously answered. [There was a big push to move toward having SAP adoption in the company.][return][return]It sounds like this is an offshoot of that?[return]Yes. Absolutely. The system implementer that we had used in that first year post go-live, we continued to use them to do some one-off fixes. We did[emdash]I dont know[emdash]probably close to 200 fixes in some different releases that had gone into production. Given the problematic areas that we had, the company that did our implementation is not likely the company that was going to get us out of the pickle that we found ourselves in. So how do we move into a place of finding an organization that was likely better suited to help us on a grander scale of not just being focused centrally on SAP, but also looking at other solutions that might be able to help supplement and/or integrate with what wed already done to really alleviate the significant pain points that we had? Thats where we started to branch out and reach out to some other companies[emdash]HP, Accenture, IBM, all the big ones[emdash]to get their take on, How do we remediate what weve got? That was the impetus for reaching out with the RFP and then ultimately selecting HP."
"A couple of things. One was that we had a number of different vendors involved in managing SAP-based applications; we had Deluxe, Fujitsu, Accenture, and HP all managing SAP-based apps across the organization, which didnt really make sense. If you were doing IT stuff, you should have it under one thing; but wed actually split it across multiple vendors. So we were looking at consolidation into one for a number of reasons: efficiency; youd be able to build a knowledge base with one central group; and then, of course, theres the cost piece on the end of it as well. I kept telling them while I was there, Disaster in production. We decided that we needed to do something more. Were we looking at moving one offshore or whatever? No, none of those things. Part of the decision role is based on whether you support or resist the advice to take and make it more efficient."
"Previously answered. [What we did was to incorporate the BPO services as part of the bigger project. When we were able to buy into Del Monte US, the main concern was how we were going to change the previous landscape to the existing[emdash]to the one that we currently have already[emdash]which is SAP platform. We considered only HP and IBM because we know that they are the only two companies that can give us all the services that we need from an end-to-end perspective. We had some previous experience, at some time in 2008, with the likes of IBM looking after the portal infrastructure managed services that we have. Also included in that was the hosting of all the existing or previously existing SAP production servers and systems. Thats the one that triggered us to consider only these two companies, considering that the major component is really the migration to the SAP platform.]"
"There are two primary needs: The first one was to make consolidation. Within the financial portfolio business units, we have three major vendors providing services[emdash]the primary being HP[emdash]and for some of the systems, Accenture and Fujitsu. We had a major requirement to consolidate the portfolio into a single vendor. The second need was to evolve our operating model into new, more cost-effective operating models. The third, obviously, as in every business unit, is the need to reduce cost."
"The need for the project is that we are performing a big internal change[emdash]from a reseller that is selling most of the time through brick-and-mortar stores to an omni-channel reseller[emdash]and therefore we discovered that our own solution, which is a self-written goods management system, is not suitable to do that change. We are looking in parallel to further developing our own IT stack for a new solution that supports the change and that gives us the possibility to use all that new technology such as iBeacons, discovering customers, and so on."
"Answered subsequently. [You need to understand a little bit more about the background. Setting up the test factories was not a new concept. Weve had multiple test factories done within the business already. HP had a space in the test factory at [indecipherable at 4:28] doing some performance testing. Cognizant had a lot of test factories going on[emdash]about four or five. TCS had their own factories. All that the enterprise test factory was going to do was streamline it from four suppliers to two suppliers and give those two suppliers all of the scope. Previously, the suppliers that were involved had only specific channels that they could be working within. So if we look at HP, they could only work in performance. Had they won the ETF, they would have been able to work in performance and all the other six channels in terms of testing. So that was the strategy for the ETF: narrow down the suppliers and open up the floodgates.]"
"We did a company restructure; we reorganized our sales organizations the way we were organized facing the market; and we had to reflect those changes in the way that SAP reflects those organizations[emdash]our internal organizations. We have the customers organized in distribution channels, sales organization offices, and responsibles for all those parts; and SAP sales modules were adapted to reflect our company structure. Mainly, it was that. We had to change a lot of things that were organizationally related within the system[emdash]pricing, for example. Prices are organized for sales organization; as the sales organization changed, we had to change also the pricing lists that we had in SAP. A lot of things like that we had to do from accounting, cost centers, organization, sales organizations, stock management[emdash]responsibility for stocks had to change. In Portuguese, the name of this project was Flexibilizacao. Thats the Portuguese name we had for that, like flexibilization. Thats just a name that we call it to reflect this need."
"At the end, all of the proposals that we[emdash]in the final round, HP, Embratel, and then IBM were selected for the three final companies. Then we started working with those three companies; and technically speaking, all of them met our requests in the process. At the end of the final round that made up the process, it was commercial issues in that process. For all three competitors, we gave them a target; and with the final target, one of them, Embratel, won this process.[return][return]So in the end, it came down to the price?[return]Yes. Also its easy to understand why Embratel[emdash]its an America Movil company. You know the company, right?[return][return]Embratel? Im not as familiar with them.[return]America Movil company [in Mexico]. Probably you know that better.[return][return]What prompted you to outsource these services, to start the whole process in the first place?[return]Not the whole process. We are trying to sustain the stability of SAP; manage inside the warehouse[emdash]our old data warehouse; manage the primary call center for the users here[emdash]what else? We have some activity here. I dont remember exactly, but its part of the new development, the new project, something Ive met; its not in the outsourcing process."
"It was a renewal. We have had an ongoing relationship with HP for more than 10 years. We completely outsource our operations, or lets say IT, to HP with an exception of a few areas. So yes, its an ongoing renewal process that has been happening for more than 10 years. We renew on a three-year basis, and every three years we go through the renewal process again."
"Give me a little bit of background. HP was being considered for Agile nearshore Java application development services, correct?[return]Yes. So, we do a bulk of our development for PAYBACK in Munich. We also have an offshore development center in India. We dont have perfect results coming from that relationship. We have high attrition in India. We have a language barrier that is much more challenging than it is between the US and India, or between Germany and India. It is certainly a challenge. Its not possible to just jump on a plane and quickly get to another location if you need to have a couple-of-days meeting or something like that. So, part of the strategy that we were looking at was to develop a nearshore partner. [return]     We also had 132 consultants working in the Munich office, which is way, way too high. The financials didnt make sense. The number of vendors that we had was 32. We worked with 32 different companies for that 132. So, we really needed a strategy that would say, Lets go with one nearshore vendor. We can push a lot of this work to a location within one hour of Munich and work very closely and collaboratively with that group to deliver for us. Its mostly software development, but there is also production support and infrastructure management, and things like that."
"This was actually a continuation of the existing one, so HP was giving the service. Its more a renewal of these aspects, so the RFP was more to look at alternates.[return][return]Did you consider any other vendors?[return]Yes, we did have other vendors. We did have IBM and Mahindra.[return][return]Who was the stronger contender between IBM and Mahindra?[return]IBM was stronger."
"There was a general decision to move to Workday as the single HR system for Nissan back in September of 2012. We have been working on that. We have been deploying in four waves. Wave one was South Africa and Hong Kong, wave two was America, wave three was Japan, and wave four was Europe. I am in charge of wave four. The business needs we had were the deployment of a mobile [indecipherable at 02:28] system to be the single source of data for all the business."
"Nissan globally decided three years ago, in October 2012, that it needs to consolidate its HR-related systems. We were working on a region basis. In other words, the North Americas had their own system, Japan had their own system, and Europe had their own system. It was decided that we need to have one global HR system."
"Theres a couple reasons. One is our system is pretty dated. Its an old, what we call, green screen IBM iSeries system, so theres many limitations to it. The other thing is we at Lear are looking at a lot of SAP implementation, not only for the purchasing side, but from the ECC side, looking at it from the accounting side, and moving more in that direction."
"It was due to the merger of two companies. Our company purchased the other company. The two companies used SAP, and now the two SAP systems must be integrated. Therefore, we needed to find a company for the implementation.[return][return]You needed these services to help you to combine the companies.[return]Yes."
"The U.K. are rolling out smart meters into the home, which are effectively gas and electricity meters that are connected to a central body, where you can get information without having to go around and read a meter physically in the home. This is an ongoing program in the U.K. [return]     Theres a central body that the government have established called the Data Communications Campaign, the DCC. Originally the DCC were going to provide the interface between them and the supplier system[emdash]so them and EDF Energy Systems[emdash]to pass data to and from about our customers. [return]     They subsequently changed their mind, so there was a redesign in their system build. Theyll say its for security reasons, but it really came down to money. They pushed that responsibility to build the interfaces down to the energy suppliers[emdash]down to the likes of us, which is gas, etc. As soon as that happened, we realized that wasnt a requirement that we build, and therefore we needed, quite quickly, to go out to market and buy that interface.[return][return]So youre not the only one.[return]Yes, every single energy supplier in the U.K. Theres what we call the big six or seven, depending on which stats youre looking at. Then we have a number of small suppliers in the U.K., so youre probably totaling around 20 or something like that, but certainly a big six or seven which will be in the same position as us, which are the main providers across the geography."
"Previously answered. [Global Sub-Category Manager: Syngenta is one of the leading companies in agrochemical business and  we have been growing significantly. We have a few target  markets and to Brazil and the whole Latin America region is one of  them. Basically we have two main areas where we do business. One is crop  production and the other one is seeds,  and we have two different ERP platforms for these in Brazil. So the  plan is to have one ERP SAP, based on SAP technology. We ran an RFP in  terms of which supplier would deliver the design work and also deliver  the implementation. This is within the bigger scope of what we call auxiliary feed  operational leverage, so there are also other streams which were not  necessarily in scope of this RFP. But there are certain dependencies and  maybe just to give you an easy example, we are also empowering our  sales force with new tools and people. People will need to be trained on  all these new technologies and changes and we dont want to do it one  by one. We put a lot of effort into this change management aspect. We  may also call it the human aspect, to make sure that we do it in a  consistent way in terms of how people are trained on new tools, new  processes, and what is changing to them.]"
"Salesforce.com executed an initiative a couple of years back by actually hiring me. I have been at Salesforce just about two years, coming up in a couple of weeks. My anniversary is coming up. They hired me to actually lead this initiative to put their strategy forward for consolidation, globalization, standardization, our outsource operation, and shared services. The strategy is to create a platform for a partner, and a platform that can help us grow to a $10 billion Salesforce. We were thinking about how we can consolidate all of our little outsource operations here and there into one, consolidate our global strategy into one, and find a partner that can help us create the future of Salesforce with the growth of 30 percent we have been having for the last few years. That was a project that we put together, and the goal was to consolidate and find the right partner. That is why we went out to the market and looked at the tier one providers: to see which one of them is the best fit for us to create that partnership."
"We had an incumbent, which was Infosys. We had some issues with Infosys. We also were looking to consolidate our operations. We had AR with a small operation in Iowa that was not really scalable to us where we were, so its growth. We wanted to consolidate the two different companies into a single approach."
"VP: Three years ago, IHG developed a business case to implement Workday as a solution and to outsource some key HR admin processes. It took a long time for the business case to get approved, but it was the usual drivers around transforming the organization, reducing costs, standardizing processes, etc. The business case evolved over time, and it ended up really with Accenture proposing a Workday solution and outsourcing for themselves, but that part was never competitively tendered. It sort of evolved into this arrangement with Accenture, and we decided it would be better to competitively tender that work to see if we could find either better pricing, or a partner that we felt might be a better fit with IHG. That is how we came to do the process which involved HP, Accenture, and HCL."
"The business had already made the decision to move to a new global HR platform, and as part of that they needed to engage a provider after there was internal dialogue around the requirements from a business perspective. The business side wished to outsource the service support provided through the change of this new solution."
"When we did a vendor selection, the factors we emphasized a lot were cost, quality, and speed[emdash]those three parts. Compared with other vendors, HP provided us the best proposal.[return][return]Who would you say was the next closest runner-up?[return]You want the specific name of the company? Basically, we had offers from close to 10 vendors, including Japanese vendors and also Taiwanese vendors. The closest one was one of the vendors in Taiwan. I do not want to disclose the name of it."
"The banks in Australia collectively have been working for some time on the opportunity to move from a physical processing of checks to digital. Because the banks need to exchange value between each other, they are very interdependent on their solutions. We needed to move at the same pace as other banks in Australia in terms of moving to a digital solution."
"Our administration system from TCS was on a contract for five years, which was coming to an end. Thats the reason we initiated another discovery of what would be the next system in the phase of the company, and whether we would want to continue with TCS or look at other systems available in the market. Thats how the whole process started."
"Somebody was already delivering the services. A company called TCS was doing that.[return][return]From there, what made you decide you wanted to look for a new vendor?[return]The platform had a lot of capability issues which were impacting our regular operations. We were growing, and those kinds of functionalities were really looked forward to from a business standpoint. We were looking at an application which would have mature functionalities for a life insurance company and has been implemented in many other countries. Incidentally, this TCS platform which we were using was also four versions down. They also had come out with a new version, which would also have been a change. They were also party to the evaluation."
"We were certainly very pushed by our incumbent provider to consider a digitized check processing platform. We are one of three banks in a utility called Vipro. Within the Vipro utility, two out of the three banks agreed that we were going to have to go and test and the market; that we couldnt remain with the provider. Likewise, the business felt that we should go out to market to test the market from a commercial perspective, and also look at what else we could do with a digitization platform with other providers so that the incumbent was only going to provide check digitization and no further digitization for our branch network. That was the catalyst for going out to market and testing HP and Fuji Xerox. We also invited the incumbent provider to respond to that tender and they declined."
"We are Turbo[emdash]our plant of the Borgwarner[emdash]and we also have another business unit. It was formerly placed in Szentlorinckata, Hungary; its in another part of Hungary. They moved here, just a few meters away from our Turbo facility; and because of this move and as they plan to grow further, both in capacity and in head count, they were looking for a payroll partner. Beforehand, payroll was done by Haldex, which was their neighboring company at the old location. This relationship ended because of the move, and now they had to look for another partner. We[emdash]I mean Turbo[emdash]already had HP for the payroll service, but the new company[emdash]the TTS; they are called TTS[emdash]insisted on doing a new purchasing project. Looking for a new partner has many options in the market, and because of this we also wrote out a project for new options. Our purchasing process goes like this: we need to invite at least three companies, optional companies, and ask for their offers and services; and after that, together with the purchasing department and the plant managers and the HR department, the final partner, the service provider is chosen. This was mainly the background."
"We had been on a rather aggressive acquisition spree the last couple of years. That included international as well as domestic. We started domestically but then expanded internationally. In doing so, we subsumed the finance and the HR functions of the companies we purchased. What we found is that we currently have an ERP system in the United States that was growing a little old[emdash]long in the tooth[emdash]so were in the process of implementing a new one which is going to be implemented for finance as well. We had not moved our acquired company offices onto finance, because we knew we were going to have this new one come out and it would have been a massive effort to change it and then change it again. But one thing we did realize is that we have a lot of people doing a lot of work that could be centralized. [return]     We have a fair amount of that centralization happening here in the US. Our office in Chicago handles the finances for all of the offices we have in the US[emdash]the companies that we have purchased[emdash]but we dont have that for the international. The purpose was twofold: (1) to centralize services, so probably[emdash]at the end, maybe a slight reduction in head count, maybe not[emdash]but to get everybody doing the same thing, and (2) to standardize how we look at things. With the number of companies and the number of offices that we bought up, we just had a multitude of ways that people would submit numbers, store numbers, report numbers; and we really needed to get beyond that. We needed to get to a standard global way of doing things.[return]     There were basically two or three objectives. One was obviously cost cutting; we realized that we were really inefficient from a cost perspective. Another one was to centralize processes; and the third was to standardize processes."
"This is a financial company. We are presently on e-commerce. We help the company to sell things on the internet, to make the legal payment transaction; and also we help the big companies here with Vodafone that need help to sell things through the internet. We allow companies to have the platforms connected to their acquires in Brazil. This bridge is our knowledge. We also provide a virtual wallet for the companies. We are similar to PayPal: we get the transactions, and then we send those transactions to the acquirers; and we also provide the wallet for people to store the credit card data and use them in the next transaction for the internet. I dont know exactly how to summarize all that, because I am not in charge of the product itself. Im in charge of the IT stuff[emdash]the best solution, computer, all that."
"I think that part of it was the business case, the savings that we could generate. Were going through this huge transformation as a company, and this is part of that transformation. Were going through this whole reorganization. Everything else is on fast track as well, so this was consistent. It had top-down management support."
"Previously answered. [For the RFP we launched with HP, the services included were back, middle, or front office for Bancomer, which is one of the banks that we own in Mexico. The problem of the service is that we didnt measure the final quantity of processes that were going to outsource. So we launched an RFP, having an account which could be the scope; but we didnt assure or warranty the number of FTIs or the number of processes that are finally going to be outsourced, because these needs are coming up year by year.]"
"The contract has expired, and the head count of the company rose a lot. This plant was shifting two new business units; this is why the head count was rising so much, and this is why we needed to make a contract modification."
"The main business need was to reduce our processing costs for incoming bills. Secondly, to get very detailed information of the bills and their content in order to optimize our own pricing, because in a pre-study phase before we made the RFP, we understood that our users in the business operation areas were not keying in every single line of an invoice, but only one per line type, by type of services. We were losing very important maintenance information on the costs. So the business need behind the process optimization is to get full transparency on all maintenance actions on our cars, so that we can price the maintenance costs in a much finer and more precise way."
"Weve been separated from Philips, and weve now moved from Philips IT services to our own IT services. So we had to look for new IT solutions to support our business processes.[return][return]So youve got a number of services to look at as you move away from Philips?[return]Actually, yes."
"The business need was, first of all, very simple. Until mid last year, we were part of Philips, and we now have been sold to Gibson Brands. Philips is using a Flame system which is quite some years old. We have an IT SLA with Philips, so we can use the Philips system for a certain period of time[emdash]until mid this year. By then, we have to have our own complete IT landscape and find solutions for every business purpose which needs to be served. This was the overall background, and it means that we have to have our own ERP system by then; but we also need to replace, stop, or whatever all other systems we used to work with. As I said, we were part of Philips until mid last year; but it was already quite clear at an earlier stage in  time that the purchase to another party would happen. Therefore, we had already started searching and looking around in 2013.[return]     In addition to this, we also have the situation that Gibson Brands does not have an IT landscape in place which can be used by us. It would would be normal, when a new party steps in, that you use the IT landscape this party already has; but in this area, and also with regard to ERP systems, Gibson Brands does not have state-of-the-art systems. Therefore, we had to select a new solution for us. This is the background of why we need to find something new."
"We had a vendor, ModusLink, and our volumes were shrinking. Modus was not able to provide us with a propositioned solution, and their quality of service has been declining. They were struggling with the profitability of the deal with us. We were looking both for improvement in quality and for much a better cost structure."
"Previously answered. [To be honest, at the time we werent very happy with ours, but we werent necessarily shopping. It was just one of those perfect timing things; and when I talked to them and saw what they offered, then we started going down that path.]"
"Theyre just on an old mainframe policy administration system like a lot of carriers are. It came to a time where they wanted to modernize and get a newer system: one that can help them grow their business and alleviate some of their existing problems they have with their older admin system."
"Question not asked."
"The real compelling factor is the change that we are undergoing a paradigm shift here inside of our organization. We are looking to transform the contact center space from treating it like the necessary evil[emdash]the complaint center; the place where you call and just hope to get some help[emdash]to a real opportunity to engage our customers to learn more about them and educate them more on our products, and to use that more as an opportunity to get them to buy more from us, understand more about who we are, and teach them more about what we are trying to do in the market place. So we are really looking for a transformation in the space. That was the primary driver.[return]     Now, that said, even if we didnt have a paradigm shift to change the business going on inside GM in the way we are looking at this function, we would have likely bid it competitively anyway because HP had been our provider in the space for some time. It is in Europe, and the region is under an extreme amount of pressure to perform financially. It would have been the right thing to do to competitively bid it just to be sure that we have the right solution for the right price."
"The specific deal that this was driven from was the mainframe services RFP that we put out."
"We are subcontracting most of our models at this time. We subcontract the majority of our activities for our server operations. We wish to reduce those operational costs by introducing a new model of activities around the activity model of cloud computing. Therefore, we have launched this action in the first place to reduce the cost and to also create more agility and flexibility among our services. We do believe that the model of IT subcontracting will tend to go forward. Thats the reason why we wanted to try to experiment and foresee any dis-approach."
"AbbVie was formed as a result of a spinoff from Abbott, and  as part of the spinoff, Abbott did not give AbbVie any IT infrastructure  to speak of. So AbbVie is having to build brand new IT infrastructure  from scratch in order to support the server compute load  that is going to be migrated out of Abbott. 80 to 90 percent of the  server environment is all brand new that HP is going to install. The  problem they were solving was getting off of their transition service  agreement onto their own IT services."
"Together with HP, we did a request for proposal where we actually went in and asked for data center consolidation.[return][return]What were the reasons behind wanting to do that consolidation?[return]Today we have a decentralized setup. Wed like to combine that in three data centers: one in Europe, one in America, and one in Asia-Pacific.[return][return]Are there anticipated cost savings and efficiencies from that?[return]You can take all of those good marketing words and phrase them, but for us, its more to bring Kaba IT to the next level, or the next generation. This is my goal."
"The company has offered a separation package in an effort to reduce payroll. We had a number of people in our area take the package, so we were looking for vendors to provide managed services[emdash]not to supplement, but to replace areas where we had lost too many people to be able to support."
"FedEx is going through a restructuring program. They are trying to take out cost. They had a voluntary buyout. A lot of the IT staff took advantage of that, so they needed to supplement their remaining workforce."
"Do you know what a smart electricity meter is? There is a government commitment in Great Britain that by the year 2020, every home in Great Britain will have a a smart electricity meter and a smart gas meter installed. In Great Britain, there is basically a competitive market for energy supply, so as a consumer you can get your electricity from one of several different suppliers, and the government wants that market to work very easily. It should be really easy to switch suppliers.[return]     When you have got a smart meter, if you want to switch suppliers, you shouldnt need to get a new meter. What the government decided to do is to buy the communications infrastructure that all the smart meters would use to connect the meters in peoples homes with energy suppliers. Basically the government set up this infrastructure a bit like the public telephone network effectively, and then the industry would use it rather than all going and buying their own arrangements, which would mean them all doing the same things. It would be very costly and duplicate lots of cost."
"AbbVie separated from Abbott at the beginning of the year. As you can imagine, we have a lot of IT infrastructure separation activities that are required to fully separate from Abbott, because we are now a standalone, fully functioning company. The separation from Abbott is really what drove the requirement to look at data center managed services. We were not going to build an organization, nor did we have facilities for our own data center. A lot of it was speed, and then running data centers isnt our core competency. Its creating medicines to cure illnesses."
"We wanted this piece of work to be done outsourced effectively rather than us doing it in-house. We thought it was the best solution.[return][return]Is this a replacement of a solution you already had in place?[return]Specifically, we are closing down a business, and as part of the closing down of the business, we need to retain some of the data[emdash]the information for that business[emdash]and make sure that we have access to it and it is available to us for typically a minimum of seven years. We have obligations to retain data with this legacy business, which we are closing down. We had to work out how best to do that. There are legacy systems at this business, which we need to think what is the best way for us to keep those live and the data available for six or seven years. The option we decided was to have a third party do that for us, host it for us, and support it for us."
"It was a government decision to install smart meters across all of Great Britain. As a result of that policy decision, they needed to get external service providers to provide the data services package of that part of the deal to make sure that service questions taken from service users were processed down to smart meters.  Resulting commands were sent back from the smart meter processor and sent back to service users."
"Its a second-generation outsourcing, and they wanted to see if there was any chance to exchange the current service provider."
"Life-cycle requirements, existing services are aging, and future demand growth."
"We own a loan servicer that we are winding down the business for. We needed to keep a portion of the data and applications readily accessible for ongoing requests.[return][return]For a certain period of time until that isnt required anymore?[return]Correct."
"Previously answered. [This is separating Abbvies infrastructure from the Abbott infrastructure to support the creation of a new company.][return][return]Is that separation what prompted the need for this purchase?[return]Yes."
"It was something that was being planned for about five or six years, so well before I started with Takeda. I joined in December 2012. About five or six years ago when the sourcing agreement was made with HP on the infrastructure part, there were other services that were being sourced with individual best-of-breed service providers. It led us to an environment in which we had about six major service providers and about 15 smaller ones. You can imagine then the complexity of the service provider landscapes. With all of those contracts coming and because of the continuous transition and transformation that the company underwent dating back from 2007 onward, there was a vision to try to co-terminate all of the contracts[emdash]or get them to expire as close as possible[emdash]to see if there was an opportunity in the market to go out and establish a wider service provider landscape with more services; to consolidate mature services into one or a few service providers and reduce the service provider landscape that way.[return][return]It looks like you ended up going down to three vendors. Have I got that correct?[return]Yes, that is correct. We do not have a strategy of going single sourcing, nor do we have an outspoken strategy for remotely sourcing. What we did say is that we have a suite of services within the infrastructure[emdash]anything basically from end-user provisioning service desks, etc., spanning across 65 different countries. It is a fairly complex beast for a single service provider, or at least it can be. What we put as our yardstick was we tried to bundle the services that we have as logically as possible. We ended up with five different bundles of services, one being the end-user centric part. Then you have the commoditized mail and SharePoint services. You have an element around side services and provisioning of remote access. You have SAP as a service stack, and then you have the traditionally-based data center services of business application hosting to the far right. So there are these five services, within each of their service stack, if you like.[return]     With the help of our external consultants, we probed the maturity in the market to see if our own thinking was in line with how the business was adjusting themselves to deliver services, where they would be completely off, or where they would actually be well received. We chose to go with the five bundles with an expectation because of the accelerated pace we wanted to run the process with, only to end up with a maximum of five across all bundles and no more than three service providers per bundle. This was simply just to maximize the through-put of the process and to ensure that we could run the process in an accelerated fashion. We anticipated to be able to run it within anywhere between 7 and 12 months.[return][return]Within those five bundles, you wanted to have no more than three providers. Do I understand that correctly?[return]Yes. For each of the bundles, no more than three service providers. That is where we down-selected, but as a total, to no more than five; because what we did was also in the political landscape that we are in with Takeda[emdash]as any organization that has a full IT organization[emdash]obviously there is a keen interest in what we are doing. We wanted to make sure that we safeguarded the interests of our Japanese and American VIPs. We looked at their current incumbency and if they would fit into the CCO landscape, so that we are not creating an island within the company but are safeguarding the entire IT journey within Takeda. That in itself, plus the availability of service providers of the geographical footprint we are looking for, already set a pace of how many service providers we could invite in.[return]     We wanted to invite HP in because they were our incumbent. They had proven their delivery in the past. There were other service providers in other regions that we wanted to take in[emdash]other incumbents that we wanted to explore the opportunity for[emdash]and we ended up with a field of 10 service providers going into the process. You have to see that in that view of looking at no more than five across the bundles and no more than three within each bundle as the down-select target.[return][return]Did all of the providers bid on all of the bundles?[return]No. There was a variety. That spanned from single bundle to five bundles, with the majority of the service providers actually bidding four or five, so that was more than half of them.[return][return]These three you listed as undisclosed that were selected are delivering the services needed across the five bundles. Is that correct?[return]That is correct, yes.[return][return]I want to make sure I can differentiate between the three undisclosed vendors.[return]I cant actually name them, but I think that by rule of exclusion, you should be able to name them yourself. Actually, it ended up being a very interesting scenario, and I have no problem disclosing that the three providers have actually bid across all five bundles. We ended up in a scenario in which we had very strong candidates from the Asia-Pac region, from the maturing Indian providers, and also an American-based service provider. If you can imagine that in our geographical footprint, and being Takeda globally, that actually fits like a glove into the political landscape that we navigate in."
"We were renewing our contract that was about to expire. We were renewing with a new provider."
"For several years, we have outsourced our SAP hosting operations. The contract needed to renew, and we decided to go for a tender."
"HP had been providing support for infrastructure hosting. It was originally EDS when Meritor first outsourced that activity. We had been in that relationship for six years. I think we extended it one additional year to do some further analysis, etc., and then we decided that it would be prudent given seven years with that arrangement to test the market so to speak, so we went out with a formal RFP process. Then ultimately, based on the analysis of those RFPs, we decided it made sense to go a different path and ultimately selected AT&T on the infrastructure hosting deal.[return]     One of the motivational factors is certainly the ability to save money in this area, as well as the application support area, so that we could reinvest those savings in funding some other necessary transformation. That was also central to driving why we went down this path. So similar dynamics in the application service space. In the application support area, we had had a relationship for about 10 years with HCL. The model was not managed services. It was more of a staff augmentation type of a support model. We did want to go to the next level or step in that type of relationship, so we were looking to move the application support to a managed services model.[return]     Similar to what we did on the infrastructure side, we went out with a formal RFP to a number of different firms related to providing that support. Based on the analysis of those responses, there were a couple things that influenced our decision. Clearly the RFP responses were an important piece, but probably equally as so was once we decided that we were going to move providers in terms of infrastructure hosting, that made us far more uncomfortable with also moving providers on the application support side of things. We decided ultimately to stay with HCL and transition from the staff augmentation support model to a managed services model. We were not comfortable going through that transition with a completely new provider in that space after we had decided to move on the infrastructure."
"Let me give you a little bit of background. Maybe this will help frame it up. We issued the RFP at least one year ago. We had several players. We down-selected to two: HP and a competitor, HCL. IBM was not. We worked that RFP through the spring, summer, and fall of 2013. Then we went into a pause mode due to some internal approval processes.[return]     We came out of 2013 into 2014, and just a couple of weeks ago, we had a call with some of the senior team at HP and informed them that although we hadnt made a final decision[emdash]and we still havent I might add[emdash]were leaning strongly to a competing supplier, HCL. As we informed Pat Vondette and the rest of the team[emdash]most of whom we here at that meeting a couple of weeks ago[emdash]that was our direction. Not a whole lot has changed since then. We havent formally given notice to HP that were exiting, but were leaning strongly to the competitor as the solution.[return]     For the last six or seven years, HP has been our data center hosting and hardware services provider for Mexico, Latin America, parts of Europe, and most of our AMEA, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific Region. This particular RFP is taking that work, plus everything that PepsiCo does for themselves in the US, plus we have other data centers that we host ourselves[emdash]we run ourselves[emdash]in parts of Europe and other parts of the world. Its bringing all the data center work in under one umbrella and then awarding that business. The numbers, if you will, that HP was supporting in the past on a server-based metric was roughly a third of what were actually sourcing. So its bigger in that regard."
"We were pretty fragmented with our infrastructure services in the international market. We had a mixture of doing it with HP and doing it with our own local people. It was probably about two-thirds HP and one-third PepsiCo associates. In our domestic markets here in the US, we ran it with our own people. We wanted to move away from a fragmented operation with too many locations, too much equipment, and non-standard equipment and manual processes; to more of an automated process with a common source of supply, and to build agility into our infrastructure services."
"We have an existing outsourcing agreement with a provider that is coming to term. This purchase process was part of our process to decide what our plan is for the dealing with that situation."
"The incumbent had a lot of issues. The incumbent wasnt providing the level of services we required. It had been a five-year effort to look at where we are in this journey, and we decided about last spring to see what our options were in an RFP process. We did an RFI, we did an RFP, and that is where we are."
"Gas Natural Fenosa is the result of the merger of two companies: Gas Natural and Union Fenosa. We merged in 2009. Each company had different vendors[emdash]different companies that were providing the operation services for IT. HP was providing the services to Gas Natural, and another company[emdash]Indra[emdash]was providing the services for Union Fenosa. So, during the last four or five years, we had both companies providing the services. We tried to match the services, and finally, HP got the whole contract. One year ago, we decided to bid the services for the coming seven years."
"It was a need for PepsiCo to move to a new service-based approach and to drive standardization and consolidation through our landscape. We are moving from a holding company to an operating company, so basically from a collection of decentralized business units to an integrated operating model. We didnt think that we could do that as efficiently or as effectively without partnering with someone who is an expert in the space."
"There were two things. One was that original HP agreement was coming to term for our international business units. Secondly, we took a look at ourselves globally and recognized that there were lots of opportunities for improvement either operationally, or on a technical platform basis. That is what started the development of the strategy, which ultimately led to the RFP process."
"The specific purpose of this job was to maintain old infrastructure belonging to Gas Natural, and to operate and maintain the servers, storage, communication elements, software, operating systems, databases, and so on.[return][return]Were you consolidating all of that into one provider, or were you trying to replace a provider?[return]Perhaps it is important. Let me explain the situation of the company. Four years ago, Gas Natural was the only gas company in Spain and in other Latin American countries. In 2009, Gas Natural took over Union Fenosa, an electricity company also based in Spain. During the last three years we have merged both companies. Now the new company is Gas Natural Fenosa, but it comes from two different companies: one gas and the other an electricity distribution company.[return]     When we decided to merge both companies, we also decided to have the same processes across the company in all business, not only in IT. We decided to manage customers, to manage channels, and to manage everything in the same way. Concerning IT, we decided to manage all the application and all the infrastructure in the same way. In 2009 we had two different suppliers operating the infrastructure, HP and Indra, because they were the former suppliers of each company. In 2012, we decided to forget Indra, move Indra out of this specific area, and we decided to offer it to HP. We decided to trust in HP as the only supplier for the operation of all the infrastructure in Gas Natural Fenosa in 2012, more or less in June 2012.[return]     We advised HP in 2012, Sirs, be careful because we have decided to sign a new contract with you for 18 months, so until December 2013. What we weigh in this period, you to be aware that in the end of 2013 we want a new service, and we will put this offer into the market. So please be careful that your contract is finished in 2013. Yes, yes, yes. Dont worry. So that HP understands our context, what we want at the company level[emdash]not only in infrastructure, not only in IT, but at the company level[emdash]what we want is not only one supplier in one service. We want two or three suppliers for the same service to have the capability to transfer services if one supplier is failing, or to be able to absorb more jobs if we have a peak or we have an overload. Our spirit at the company level is to have several suppliers for several services. We dont like to have only one supplier and one service and to be 100 percent dependent on it. To answer your question, what we have decided is not to change HP with another supplier, but to add more competitors so we will have the possibility to make transfers and to have internal competencies."
"I think the contract has been running for eight years. It is time for a rebid. It is part of our procurement process. The contract has run its term."
"We started in August of 2013. We are in a start-up situation. We started operating in the Brazilian market as a bank, and we intend to grow very very fast. It is important to have an IT partner to support all the services in terms of infrastructure: I mean data center hosting and technology services as a whole, field services, technical support, and so on. We intend to grow very fast. In this situation, it is important to develop the relationship with an IT partner that will support us during that time. At first we are very small compared to the other players in the market, but we intend to grow very fast. The primary purpose of the proposal process was to find an IT partner to help us to grow."
"There were two big things. We were getting ready to move data centers, so basically move out of the HP facilities and move out of our existing internally hosted data centers; to combine and go into two new data centers that were a co-lo scenario. That project is going on right now. We are getting into a position to figure out what our expense is going to be as we had this double capacity. The second reason was that we can save money, but the primary reason was the data center effort."
"Answered subsequently. [We obviously wanted them to have a certain amount of authorization to  the network components, and while we have been talking to HP over the  last number of months[emdash]probably a year[emdash]they never showed any flexibility  in that area. They said, No, no. This must be done by us. We cant give  you that access. As a result of those discussions, we then went to  market and we went into tender. Then all of a sudden, their approach  changed and they could become more flexible. That didnt actually go  down well with people. We want to see the flexibility when we start  talking, not because they are under pressure.]"
"It looks like you are purchasing a combination of infrastructure and app management services. Is that correct?[return]Yes. It is basically managed services of the infrastructure and the apps. The tools and the infrastructure are owned by us, and the managing and maintaining the SLAs is provided by the service provider."
"The customer wants to go to a multi-sourcing approach from a strategic point of view and selected the LAN service as the first service he wants to tender. The current provider basically also decided not to compete."
"The back story is that we had a 10 year agreement with HP. It would have expired in May of this year, so we went to market and looked at replacing, or at the minimum, improving on what we had in place.[return][return]Were there leanings internally to renew, or were there leanings in the other direction to find something else?[return]We were fervently of the belief that we were going to sell them out.[return][return]What had happened to cause that type of a sentiment?[return]I think it was a general feeling of malaise where our folks thought that HP was not aggressively or intelligently managing the account, but rather were treating us like just another client. There was not a lot of thought leadership coming in. The day-to-day performance was okay, but there was far too much of a reliance on, It is not in the contract. It is not in the contract. It is not in the contract. Trying to milk additional funds out of a longstanding relationship. There were some questions about overall performance. There had been some failures where it seemed like HP had taken their eye off the ball, and there were questions about, Should that be happening or shouldnt it?. Maybe it is time to get somebody new in here. We think we are paying too much. All those sorts of things.[return][return]How close did TCS get to taking the business away from HP?[return]Quite close.  If there wasnt a hurdle of switching costs, we probably would have  gone down that path. In the end, HP came in and actually did a good job  of winning the deal."
"ISD LATAM: This is an initiative that we are leading from ISD LATAM. ISD is IT. It is mainly based in operational efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives. That is the main background of why we needed this project."
"End of contract with HP.[return][return]Is it standard due diligence to go through a process like this, or was there anything else driving it?[return]Originally there was a big global strategic effort that coincided with the end of the contract. Thats what started it.[return][return]What was the objective of that strategic effort that was going on?[return]To develop a global data center and hosting services strategy."
"Who would you have considered to be the closest runner up to HP for these services?[return]Nobody,  because we already worked with HP for the last years. It was a renewal  of the contract. The environment is running in Frankfurt in an HP data  center, so it was not even logical to ask another party. Last year, there  was a chance that we would move everything from the current data center  to a Dutch data center in Holland. That business case wasnt positive.  That is why it was decided to stay at Frankfurt; and as the old contract was almost ending, we started the renewal of it.[return][return]This was specifically for the apps of CCBS, your customer care and billing system.[return]Correct.[return][return]The understanding I got is that it was Huawei they were competing against.[return]Yes,  that is correct. HP in this case is responsible for the intra  part. It is running within HP. It is quite  a big data center, so HP is responsible for the intra parts[emdash]the  network and also the hardware[emdash]and also some parts of the software  environment. It is not an actual managed service provider. It is  not allowed to call them that because the service desk is simply in KPN. It is more like a service integrator. They are actually  managing our third parties, including Huawei. Huawei is responsible  for CCBS, which actually is 80 percent of the Telfort mobile domain.[return][return]Was there a point at which you considered moving what you are doing with HP over to Huawei?[return]No. Maybe Huawei wanted to take over some parts[emdash]for example, a process like problem management[emdash]but that was not an option for me. I wanted to stay with HP and make sure we have a new agreement for the coming years."
"To be honest, the contract was ending mid-2014, so we needed to reconsider what we would want to do with the HP contract. There were a number of opportunities with HP. We had a logical reevaluation moment for the contract with HP and the management of the Frankfurt systems, so that was the main reason. We were arguing what to do with the platform, because we had to choose to migrate the platform to a new type of platform or stay on the current platform while expanding the profit we get from the current platform. That was the main discussion."
"It was the amalgamation of four companies, which became the new Northbridge. We have computer centers throughout Canada. We really want to consolidate into one data center. There are services that we as an organization arent doing as well because they are dispersed among the four. We are really trying to have a solidified solution, and more robust and up-to-date services."
"Basically what we need is managed service for our data centers. We are an insurance company, and our core competency is not managing data centers and we dont. The company is a mid- to small-sized company with about 1,500 people. We dont have the skills of large companies to create a tier three data center. Our driving need is to partner up with a company that can actually provide us with those managed data center services that we can utilize."
"Actually, there was not a business need. Normally the business pushes that we need to do something in IT, but in this case it was just the opposite. We are convinced that we have improved in potential and cost reduction in our IT environment. Therefore, we started from the IT side to push this. That is why we started with the RFI and RFP."
"We bought a new company in Peru, Argentina, and Chile. We started a consolidation process for IT because we have six data centers among these three countries and we have to collapse it into one main data center and one second data center. The motivation is consolidating the infrastructure over Chile, Argentina, and Peru of the new company we bought some months ago."
"Since the beginning of time, GSKs environment in the world of AS400s[emdash]that particular operating system environment and hardware environment[emdash]has been entirely an insourced engagement. We used to run a piece of our ERP system off of the AS400s. Over the years, the AS400 environment has begun to lose its market share. In the last five years or so, the only support environment that we have had on the AS400 space has been only required for Lotus Notes. Our exposure to what we needed AS400 for has dramatically reduced. We were looking to move from an insourced support environment to an outsourced supplier; fully supplier-supported maintenance, care, and feeding of the AS400s."
"The renewal of data services management.[return][return]Who was the previous service provider for those services?[return]HP."
"At the time that we started, we were going through a large transformation of our global information services organization. As part of that transformation, we were changing some of the locations from which we were delivering our own internal services. My current team is split between Switzerland, the Philippines, Australia, and Argentina. We announced that as part of that change, we were closing our offices in Australia from a delivery of information services perspective. We were also reducing the size of our teams in Switzerland.[return]     There were some fairly large personnel changes, and we felt that while we were planning such a large transformation with our overall organization, it was the right time to question again how we sourced those services. We reviewed that in the past on different occasions and had chosen to keep those services as internal services, but we reviewed that decision again as part of this organizational change and decided to trigger this RFP to help support the final decision about whether we should source these services externally or continue to deliver them internally.[return][return]It sounds like you did decide to source.[return]We decided to source them externally and Wipro won that work, yes."
"Were doing what we call an infrastructure transformation. We are looking to consolidate our data centers, the way we manage our data centers, and the technology for Spectra Energy. Today they are scattered all over North America. We wanted to bring them from eight data centers to two data centers."
"We have eight data centers spread across the company, and it looked like an opportunity for us to consolidate and save some money."
"There were two major reasons. The first one was a question of money. They felt that social resources cost too much. They are trying to make a social plan. First of all, that is why they made this bid. Second of all, because they thought also that they didnt have a good level of services. From my point of view[emdash]I have stayed nine months inside Ipsen[emdash]I think they have good services with actual resources, but they dont have a good method. That is why it is a little tweaking, because I think they were wrong to think that they dont have a good level of service, but that is their decision.[return][return]Atos was their incumbent who was delivering it originally. Is that correct?[return]Yes."
"We needed a partner to outsource our data center to.[return][return]Why did they want to outsource their data center?[return]Because our infrastructure was quite old. We couldnt meet our business needs plus the new applications we are purchasing these days. We needed to reduce costs also. We had a huge team in charge of the data center, and it was quite expensive."
"We had multiple data centers across our enterprise. We are based in Canada and the US. We had basically eight different locations where we had data center type activity going on. We were trying to consolidate down into one primary and one disaster recovery site. Along with that, it put us in a situation where we wanted to be more centrally located between our Canadian facility and our US facilities and have just one location to have to deal with under the same rules and equipment and everything else; versus having multiple sites with multiple equipment and multiple charges, and all those types of things."
"For this specific deal which we invited HP to, the idea was to find a service supplier to consolidate the data center activity in Payroll. Payroll is a company that ADP bought in Chile, and the first idea was to try to consolidate that in our operation here in Brazil, but we had some limitation because there are a lot of restrictions to move data from customers in Chile out of Chile. We decided to re-engineer the IT process in Chile using one third party. To do that, we prepared a request for proposal."
"We were a start-up company making new products. Daimler is a huge old company in the car industry. It is a heavy industry with manufacturing globally. In the moovel and car2go business, we are dealing with car sharing. That is a new Internet-based company and product where we are not selling cars and we are not doing rental cars, but we are doing free-floating car-sharing, which is an online Internet service. We had different challenges not compatible with the huge car manufacturing industry. We were looking for new IT operations and a new partnership."
"<i>Answer given in writing and not in oral interview:</i>[return]Time to market, and flexibility in infrastructure possibilities to change all and define processes which fit our business.[return][return]Answered subsequently. [We are looking out for an ITIL enterprise operation. That may be a conflict because HP, IBM, and T-Systems are really good in operating standard software in a good known way, but we dont have a product which is 100 percent standard software. We have really individual software, and we have the business need to release business functionality really fast.]"
"The business need is threefold. One is around efficiencies for enterprise services like HR, finance, IT, infrastructure[emdash]so driving efficiencies, lower costs. Secondarily, it is around service quality. Lastly, it is around the integration of those functions[emdash]to become much more of an end-to-end process rather than a functional silo. Those three things drove us to issue the RFP for partners doing that."
"We issued a formal RFP on January 1 of this year. Three vendors responded to that, HP being one of the three. We were looking for a transformation in the way we were delivering mainframe services to the GE businesses. We were in a contract with IBM that is not typical of the standard outsourcing agreements that IBM writes with clients. We owned our data center. We owned our hardware. We still held ownership of a large majority of the software licenses. The primary thing that IBM provided to us was licensing for IBM products, and they provided us with personnel in the form of technical support teams to essentially run our operation for our mainframe customers."
"Since we are a 100 percent subsidiary to Daimler AG, we are still connected to the local data center that is provided by Daimler. Since we are a fast and flexible growing entity with specific business needs in terms of scalability, automization, globalization, etc., it turned out that our business needs cannot be sufficiently solved by the Daimler AG local data center. Therefore, we were looking for a suitable partner in the market. This led to a tender with HP participating."
"The Eurocontrol agency was organized per directorate. This means that every individual directorate had its own IT. I had a colleague who was managing the IT infrastructure, for instance, of another directorate. Since last year, we have been in the process of consolidating the IT into one organization. This means that we take over the IT infrastructure from all the other directorates while they take over from us the management of the office environment. In doing that, we needed to consolidate the processes also, and we took the opportunity of this project to go for another ITSM solution because the current solutions are too different. We needed one ITSM solution for the agency. We published the tender to select this new ITSM solution and the solution providers."
"The business need was that car2go started out in 2008 an internal project within Daimler. As such, they had to go to their data center. The data center over here is very good. It is ITYL-based, and they do all the good projects within the company, but they are not quite fit for dealing with a company like car2go. The main difference is that car2go is 24/7. It needs to be always on. This is a different condition. If you have your SAP system, it runs all day, but if you have a weekend, there is no problem to have an outage or downtime. The data center is more inward oriented with the internal project. car2go has the need to be 24/7, which means it really needs to run all the time within all the time zones. This is quite a different thing.[return]     They are also very agile, which means that businesspeople will come in and say, We need to do this. We need to do that. This is a change that the internal data center will not sustain because they are not built to do this. They are built to support processes. This is a completely different focus. This is how the IT landscape has changed so that most of the start-ups and modern companies, they will need to be very agile to be competitive."
"Basically, our contract was expiring. We had two outsourcing contracts with TIVIT: one for SAP systems and one for all other systems. It was a five- and six-year contract, and they both were about to expire. We decided to go to the market and check out other data center companies[emdash]what they were offering as far as technology, processes, people, and obviously our business case in terms of cost[emdash]and identify opportunities for cost savings and innovation for our environment. Basically, that was our motivation: end of contract. Also, after six years with the same company, we wanted to know if we had a good service provider.[return][return]Did you combine those two contracts into one or did you still keep them as two?[return]We combined them.[return][return]What was the workload that you needed, if you recall?[return]The RFP process was a one-year process. My colleague is responsible for data center services. He will be responsible for the technical specificity of designing the solution that we were looking for and also, with our data center team, analyzing these proposals. Technically speaking, our procurement team was responsible for the commercial evaluation and negotiation combined with our AES core procurement team as well. So, it was a very heavy year as far as analyzing and negotiating."
"To give you a context, we were planning to enter into the credit card business in India. We were evaluating a couple of vendors for providing us credit card services. HP was one of the contenders, but in the meantime what happened was we bought the Indian credit card portfolio of the Royal Bank of Scotland. HP was the vendor providing them the services. That is where we are in our selection for a vendor of credit card services."
"We are providing an Internet service. Everything we do is Internet-based. Even though we have vehicles that run on the street, the service itself is based on the Internet using a smart phone app and everything. This is fairly new to an automotive company that is building cars. Of course you have IT inside Daimler as well, but IT inside Daimler is usually tied to enterprise systems[emdash]the typical ERP systems[emdash]everything you need to run the company but not from a customer facing service point of view. In many other companies, the IT is not really set up to satisfy customer processes that typically come with an Internet business in the first place.[return]     So, we were confronted with a lot of challenges with our internal IT regarding processes, flexibility, and agility that could not with just a lot of task force mode operations be implemented inside our typical IT when it comes to Daimler. Even though we are independent of Daimler on an operational basis, we have in the past used Daimler resources in the IT environment to run our systems. At a certain stage we decided we need to do our own stuff there and really set up an environment for us that is cloud-based and allows us to satisfy our business requirements, which are different from what you typically find inside of Daimler.[return]"
"The chief architect brought forward a new vision for the enterprise that we wanted to move forward with. A key enabling component of that was going to be the capabilities that are normally expressed in a cloud: rapid on-demand as a service delivery of infrastructure callable by direct APIs and interfaces and so forth. His desire was to have a capability like that in place as rapidly as possible. He turned to me and said, Go make that happen. Get me a cloud."
"It is part of our strategy.[return][return]Is it a new developing strategy?[return]Yes. I joined TD about a year ago and I started a set of initiatives, and one of those was to build a cloud capability for on-premise as well as in public."
"We are a more-or-less known TK company, not because we are so big, but because we are a very recent company. This deal in Rio was the biggest German investment ever made outside of Germany in the entire history of their country. It was a total investment of 6 billion euros and so much confusion afterwards. To be very accurate, this month is the end of our fiscal year and we have, for the first time after four years of operation, broken even. We are very excited about it, but up to this point we have wasted a lot of money; not only the 6 billion at the start with the Capex investment, but also the operational expenditure was very high in the first year. Because of this, it was very problematic. A lot of people were talking about it. ThyssenKrupp group was affected by the share prices and so on. CSA is very well known within the group because of those reasons; not only our sales, but also our cousin company in Alabama, US, but that was already sold. We went through a merge and acquisition period for 18 months at the beginning of this year, but TK in the end only sold half of it. It sold the Alabama side[emdash]which is downstream of our initial processes[emdash]to one of our competitors, but not CSA. For CSA, the offers were very low and the top management trusts the teams decision here. If they could wait for one or two years more, but not even this. It was a half a year more. We would finally start seeing good results and much better performance regarding the position of operations and financial figures. They have geared up to sell us by now. Nobody knows the official story of course, but thats us. We are always in the spotlight."
"What drove the need for this purchase?[return]Many things knitted together. First of all, we had entered into a long relationship with our current provider. We were not that happy with the motivation they were expressing to us; the ability to make some basic improvement and so on was not that high. Actually, at that time, they were asking us to pay for the analysis and so on. Second, it was a response to a big program we went to which was called Spirits, where actually we should be able to reduce the allowed cost of the IT department by 20 percent in three years. I would ask [our provider], What can you do about it, and how can you help us? and naturally, the answer was, We cannot help you. So we were the trigger and the model as well.[return]     We were using this company as service based; and actually, from time to time, what happened was that instead of having big, experienced people managing the infrastructure, we ended up with a lot of juniors. We were mainly busy with doing knowledge transfer and repeating 10 to 15 times the same story every year. We finished by ending this situation and launching this RFP."
"In July 2013, we were hosted at IBM in the standard computers[emdash]that is, the normal structure[emdash]and we had been operating for five years. Thats where our data center was since 2009. For five years we operated under the standard structure at IBM. At this point, we had three issues on which we had to make a decision: we needed to renew the hardware[emdash]in other words, do a technological update of the hardware; we needed to do the technical update of the software; and we also needed to move toward a solution that was more flexible and on the same level as the equipment[emdash]in other words, where I would be able to reduce and increase as needed.[return]     At this point, we launched into the market an RFP, which is a request for a quote to be made. In this quote, we had as participants IBM; HP; Activity, which is a Brazilian company; UOL Diveo, which is also a Brazilian company; and some others. In this request, the first point was a reduction in the costs of the data center structure; the second point was to have an infrastructure that was malleable[emdash]in other words, that allowed reduction or increase according to need, paying according to use; the third point was that we have the same performance or a better performance than we had in the old environment. That is where we were able to visualize that our solution lay in the cloud.[return][return]Besides IBM and HP, which were the other companies that you sent a request to?[return]Tapa, Google[emdash]that is the famous American Google[emdash]Activity, and UOL Diveo.[return]     Another thing is that in this time, we had two centers: one in IBM and another of our own, inside our company. Our system is very integrated[emdash]for example, sales, SAP, account systems, account payable, and other things. At this time, we had two data centers in two different locations; and this was a problem, because interface between the systems is very complicated. This is one very fine point. Two, we wanted to define one provider only[emdash]one data center only. I integrated everything in the same data center today. This is a very nice advantage. You have one infrastructure for all the systems in the same data center. It simplifies everything you have integrated."
"We had a big company with almost 55 companies all over the world with a lot of different ERP all over the world, and different processes. We have a lack of standardization and organizational processes in systems and in order to reduce the risk. We have old technologies around the world, so I know that we need to reduce the risk of technology, improve efficiency of processes, and standardize IT system and IT governments and business governments.[return]     In both processes, we decided to start a new transformation program with all of those companies. To do this, we chose to start this big ERP implementation based on SAP technology for standard ERP, and a lot of other systems like supplier relations, contact center, and other services[emdash]I dont know[emdash]a lot of things that we see. That is the reason. The program is a big program: five or six years long at this stage."
"The need for cost reduction, consolidation, and more flexible contracts.[return][return]When you say consolidation, do you mean that you had a number of different providers working with you?[return]We did have an idea to try to consolidate, but I also talked to more a technical consolidation[emdash]some consolidation of data centers and services, reduced footprint, those sorts of things[emdash]and the move to the cloud."
"It was purely because we were playing on what the current cost is of running operations. Because of the way this deal progressed, it came out very clearly that the customer is actually looking for a cost reduction. At the same time, they would not like to risk their operations. So cost reduction is one aspect. While we were signing the contract or agreement with HP, it was made very clear that whatever price point we agreed on with the customer, HP should be able to meet that to a reasonable extent. Because we are front-ending the bid, if we agreed to a price and HP could not give us a comfortable feeling that they could meet the price point which is attributed for their part, then we would reopen the bid to look for other partners. However, HP was reasonably close to the target which we had expected in terms of the price points."
"These are new services your organization is going to offer, correct?[return]Exactly. Even from an HP side also, I understand there have been new initiatives that theyre planning, mainly for the support services and enterprise cloud related activities on the SMB segment."
"ING, I think this was a bit of a new thing. We didnt want to prescribe too much on the solution. Therefore, we asked for a vendor solution in relation to building a cloud. There were not too much prerequisites from ING. Normally, we prescribe all what the functionality and everything. We had framework and all the other things were open for the parties to answer.[return][return]What was prompting this in the first place? What were the strategies? Is this a strategic development process?[return]Yes. Absolutely so. This is strategic to us. We are still, at the moment, we have all the platforms in-house, I would say. We have a legacy environment and need to come up, and we want to move to a flexible and efficient platform."
"We have a new IT strategy. Ive been in my role for a year now and Ive been brought in to basically, on a global basis, modernize our infrastructure, prepare us for more agility, deal with some of our risks and some of our challenges, significantly reduce the landscape, and actually start to provide world-class infrastructure, on a global scale underpinning ING Bank. We have a next major strategic imperative to, basically, TIF infrastructure services. We play around on the IT and rethink how our whole operating platform, the on-the-line technical architecture, functions in the role that we play underpinning the bank site; all the way from the data center locations to the platform architecture. One of the areas I look after is the workplace environment, which is running under a separate initiative."
"We could talk about that for hours or just talk about the main points. Lets do the second, the main points. We have outsourced our complete IT infrastructure. What we did keep in-house is the development and maintenance of our core applications[emdash]specialized applications, such as SAP and others. We have now outsourced our data center operation, with all our servers and the WAN connection and the client computing, such as Notebook. I just want to leave it with these main points.[return][return]Was the purpose to gain increased efficiency?[return]We had concluded a contract previously with a competitor of yours, CSC, and now the contract has ended. We have decided not to renew the contract. We want to put it out for entirely new bidding, actually, at the end of the contract."
"The first is an internal evolution. Eurocontrol is a company with several directorates. In terms of IT, there is a fission of the main two directorates; before now, each directorate owned its own ITSM solution. The intention of this new contract is to centralize the ITSM solution for each directorate. That was one of the first concerns. [return]     The second thing is about the multisourcing context. We have outsource contracts for our server environment, our network environment, and our office automation environment; and we need a centralized ITSM solution to support each service desk of this multisourcing environment."
"First of all, it is important to understand that the client, when they started to prepare an RFP, was not so clear about what they really wanted. The tender was prepared that way. It was pretty much open to different kinds of solutions, ranging from the Cloud solution to the delivery of respective hardware directly to their data center. It was very obvious from all the proposals[emdash]not only from HP but also from the other vendors[emdash]that each of the vendors approached it a little bit differently. For example, HP shared the ability to provide the solution based on Cloud services, where, for example, PONTECH, the small company, focused just on the delivery of a not-so-well integrated solution and on a really low price. This company, CGS, is a manufacturing company producing tires, and they are a very price-centered business, so their approach is little bit different than HPs. HP had a much more complex proposal, and from the technical point of view, I would say a much better proposal; but in terms of money there was really a huge difference between these two proposals[emdash]the winning one and the HP one.[return][return]Is this an upgrade for them?[return]Its more about the SAP. It wasnt about SAP infrastructure. Basically, CGS is a holding company. They have three tire companies: Rubena, Mitas, and Savatech. They are spread all around the Czech Republic. One branch is also in Slovenia, and theyve also got a branch in the United States. Dont ask me where, because I dont know it; Ive never been to it. All these three companies are using SAP, but they use a completely different infrastructure for each of the branches. One is built on PLUM System, one is on Bento Solutions, the third one is some Unix[emdash]I think IBM Unix, but Im not sure. Theyve decided to make one infrastructure for all these three companies. I said that they had not decided in the beginning what they really wanted; the reason is that there were pushes from the different companies to go for the platform that theyve got experience with. So when we started to put together the RFP, I was pushing them to decide for one platform and one solution. They were not willing to make this kind of decision, so the RFP was pretty much open in scope."
"Currently within ING, we have a dispersed landscape. From an infrastructure perspective, we have all technologies known to mankind. There are 80 data centers. In those 80 data centers, there is a huge variety in technology, technology vendors, and technology partners that results in a lot of effort from a resourcing perspective to life-cycle management, to upgrading, to doing the automation, to doing the security. As a target, we said, We need a standardized environment from an infrastructure perspective, computer network and storage, and the management tools around it so we can be more effective and deliver identical services throughout the organization for all business units."
"It was the implementation of the corporate intranet for our company worldwide, and we were going to start from scratch. The application is still nonexistent, so its a project for a new application."
"Our strategy is to bring more of our data away from the different applications into the cloud and the Internet in general. So more and more, we will have our data not with the users anymore, and they have to load the data from quite far away. Specifically for that, these WAN optimizers are required to give a better performance of those capabilities. Thats one thing, to increase the performance of our accessing remote data.[return]      The other thing is the prioritization of particular traffic. We are going in the direction of more video and voice services for our users also served by Internet-based services and this kind of big-time traffic needs the proper prioritization compared to other data traffic. Thats the second reason why we need optimizers to do that."
"The overall ambition here is to dramatically standardize our infrastructure and, at the same time, fully automate our provisioning processes, as well for the infrastructure as the applications; and that, combined, is called a zero-touch fully automated private cloud[emdash]not a public cloud, but a private cloud, on-premise, in our own data centers. That basically meant that we needed a couple of capabilities: a fully standardized infrastructure architecture; and at the same time, a software suite that was able to automate the most relevant processes in the infrastructure, as well as in application deployments. We call it the continuous delivery pipeline."
"For us it was a couple of things. If you look at the legacy IT workspace, were in the financial vertical; and being a bank, we do things in a very old, traditional way. We develop systems very ITIL based, Six Sigma, PMLC, SBLC[emdash]all the disciplines you can wrap around doing a program. Its what we do today. What that actually translated into was a problem for us that said in the new world where banking is now being challenged by nontraditional providers[emdash]so think of this: we can go down a path of anything from a Starbucks to a Google or anybody; but PayPal is always one I like to use. So PayPal actually, for all intents and purposes, starts to act like a bank. They take payments, they process payments, they do all this kind of fun stuff. Thats not necessarily something that we would always play in. However, when you start to take notice of them and they become multi-billion-dollar companies, they in turn start to become something that is, Okay, youre not entirely in my space, but youre starting to choose something thats recognizable that were probably going to want to compete in.[return]     So this is something where the bank had stood back. Our chief architects vision was to say, How do we get more nimble? How do we become the differentiator in the industry? Our differentiator in the past has been the customer service[emdash]legendary customer service is what we call it. It has served us very well; but again, we do recognize that in the financial vertical, thats not a hard thing to clone and our competition is cloning it and catching up to us. What were looking at now is what that next thing is thats going to separate us from everybody else, and one of them is speed to market: speed to market on new technology, speed to market on applications such that we can get out there quickly, get in front of our customers, maybe not always having the perfect product every time, but getting more product out there and offering a wider set of services.[return]     Inside of all that, add one other piece, which is common services. Today[emdash]and most banks work like this[emdash]if you go and get a loan, the balance system for the loan is written in that application. The balance system for your credit card is in that system. The balance for your savings account is in that system. We dont have any of what we call microapps or microservices. By leveraging and making all those things containers, we can turn around and make our speed to market much faster. So this all translates into a coined term that we have[emdash]and its out there in the industry in different words[emdash]what we call IT trio. We call IT trio that old methodology: put in the money, do all the disciplines, do all the fun stuff within 18 months from the time we pick up something to the time we can put it out as an offering to our customers. We want to turn that around and do it in weeks.[return]      In order to do all of that, we required[emdash]and this brings it back full circle now to why were having this conversation[emdash]why we went to the vendors in the industry, and we said, We need infrastructure as a service. We need you to do it in an open and standard way, and we also need you to do it in a way that is a, what we would call, by-the-drink model. In other words, I just want to be able to go out and say, I need four business modules and I need these kinds of services packed on top of them, and then I need to add these applications in. Create for me the container of all that work; and then, boom! I can sit down and start doing it. So now I can take these young kids that come out of universities, all these coders, and let them go and code. They dont need to understand how many virtual CPUs they need and how much storage they need[emdash]all this kind of fun stuff. We want to be able to give them the containers they need to be able to do their job immediately. Let them do what they do best.[return]      That is what our RFP went out to do. We went out to HP, we went out to Cisco. Originally we had also used IBM, but they got knocked out because their X86 Server business was sold to Lenovo. Then we also looked at Dell; but we didnt see them as an enterprise player, so we didnt go down that space. I knocked it down to HP and Cisco, those two providers, at that point in time."
"In a nutshell, the main idea is that Beaulieu International is growing or emerging from a western European-oriented company toward a worldwide company; and our current ICT infrastructure and organization was designed for support and services for western Europe. If you go worldwide, you have time differences; you have language problems; and also you should have a scalable infrastructure which you can expand into the different corners of the world. That was what we were originally looking for during the business project."
"I guess our primary objective was total cost of ownership reduction. There were multiple initiatives and projects that required WAN optimization to really mitigate the incremental costs associated with those projects. In some cases, but to a less extent, its around managing quality of service; and I guess the third objective, really, was around our ability to do reporting and troubleshooting.[return][return]And Im sorry, so your ability to self serve on that? Tell me what you mean by that third objective.[return]Some of it, yes. HP already offered substantial end-to-end services, so using this service would enable us to pursue HP to deliver the sort of reporting and analytical services. But self serve in the sense that we would directly use the infrastructure to do it ourselves. We would obviously have done that through our partner."
"A couple of things. One was flexibility and the ability to right-size the loads they are currently handling. Their structure changes in terms of M&A; they just divested quite a significant part of their business, which was a plastic packaging business. They may well acquire other businesses to grow in Asia. When youre a company thats divesting and acquiring, you need the ability to step up and step down your IT quite quickly. A key driver was flexibility, the ability to step up and step down as they acquire or divest businesses; and I would say a second key one was cost. In their current data center, their current ITS, they were nearing end of life for most of their platforms; they were facing a big capital refresh, and they didnt want to do that. So it was both avoiding a significant capital refresh of their existing IT estate and seeking lower operational costs."
"The current data center, which was being managed and hosted by Proxar, was reaching eight years old. It was a very traditional-type data center arrangement whereby we, REXAM, still owned the hardware, but we procured the hosting and managed service from HP. It required quite a large capital investment to replace the hardware. REXAM also, over the last five years, has been seeking to reposition itself as a primary global cans manufacturer. Therefore, weve been divesting some of our other businesses[emdash]our glass and our plastics businesses[emdash]which meant that the underlying infrastructure was way oversized for what we needed. So, in a nutshell, it was a good opportunity for us to look at the global infrastructure for data center and say, Is it still the right fit for REXAM? and What options do we have? Different technologies have moved quite a bit in eight years."
"Abbott, which was a Fortune 100 company, made a decision in October of 2012 to separate the company into two entities, both Fortune 200s. The new company that was spun off obviously did not have any network and voice infrastructures organizations, and the RFP was as a result of that business decision to separate the companies."
"Its a combination of things. Our DIT in our agencies is delivered through different business units, and there is a strategic objective to go to a single IT within the agency. Each of the business units today has its own ITSM solution deployed, so we need to have one single ITSM solution to support the IT of the agency, if only to reduce the costs. Its mainly reorganization, cost reduction, and support contracts on some of the existing ITSM solutions that are coming to expiration."
"Two years ago, I set up this outsourcing agreement with HP for Sulzer Pumps. We have two SAP platforms within Sulzer Pumps. I took one of the platforms at the time and outsourced that to HP. However, we still retained the water SAP system within the business, so we were running that ourselves. From that point of view, it was quite natural for us to take the second step and set up the SAP from the water business on the same platform as the rest: at HP."
"Basically, the infrastructure is currently located in an old data center. The applications and services are running on very old hardware and old versions of Windows and SQL databases as well. We have Windows 2003 ending support now. Thats probably the compelling event that caused us to decide to move our services to a different environment.[return][return]Are those the main applications?[return]Yes, there is a variety of applications. They are all bespoke applications that have been developed over the years specifically for this companys operations, where the logistics business and these applications relate to tracking, delivering, and invoicing of parcels."
"We knew that we had a big deployment to do. Were moving out of one of our existing data centers, and were also installing a large amount of new equipment. The amount of stuff that were installing is about 50 percent of what weve already got in a managed hosted data center. We were looking at how we were going to do that, and how we were going to do that for a reasonable price; because according to the original contract with our existing vendor, if wed gone ahead and basically stuck in more stuff to that point, the cost would have been too much for the business to bear. So we were looking at alternatives. We started an RFI process[emdash]or a tender, in fact[emdash]to find a new data center vendor; and that went to the current managed hosting vendor, and it went to a number of organizations, including HP."
"Basically, since we launched the shared services in 2013, we were looking to replace the existing vendors with someone that was more international and available in Hong Kong, US, and so forth, being able to fulfill our needs in terms of capacity, evolution, and so forth. Thats why we launched this RFP."
"The back story is that we run on an SAP system. Weve hosted our own hardware since we first put the system in, in 2001. The current hardware is quite old, and its due to be replaced, so we had two options: do we replace it with our own hardware on-site; or do we look to a third party to provide it as a service? Nowadays, technologys moved on; theres a lot more of that sort of thing around. Last time we looked at replacing the hardware, the services available werent that good. We felt the time had come to look at the option of looking at some sort of hosting environment, as it was worthwhile. Thats why we started looking at hosting.[return]     We involved HP because we wanted to deal with a credible partner. Although we host the hardware ourselves, the software itself is currently supported by a company called Atos. So we approached Atos, and we also approached HP to get a competitive quote. There were a couple of other companies involved as well. There was a company called Logicalis, who are a UK company. We also approached a company called CSI, which stands for Computer Systems Integration, who weve done a little bit of work with. They were recently acquired by a company that provided hosting environments.[return][return]And you also looked at Dell?[return]Dell is our preferred hardware supplier, and we currently run on Dell hardware, so thats why we were interested in talking to them."
"Wed made an applications centralization strategy, so for our applications centralization control, weve obviously got to have somewhere to host it. We dont have a centralized hosting instance, and therefore I wanted to run with some other service, because I dont want to touch any tin. I dont want any tin in the business at all, if I can manage it. We dont need it. Id rather have active managed services[emdash]my IaaS, my PaaS, and my SaaS are all right. If I can get there, thats what I want."
"Internal reorganization. Sulzer has made a strategy of not building up SAP Basis expertise internally. We outsource that to those companies that specialize in supporting SAP systems[emdash]not just the hardware, but network connectivity and SAP Basis support."
"In fact, its not really the business needs because its not driven by a business request. Its more driven by the need of consolidation of the global management of the infrastructure, meaning that we were managed by several companies previously and we have a need to have a consolidated company all over the world, meaning in all the different regions: Asia-PAC, Americas, and EMEA."
"Weve been in essentially the same IT outsource contract for around a decade. There was an initially termed contract of, I think, five years with HP; and it continued to be extended until it reached almost the decade mark. It needed to go out to market again; but also we needed it to go out to market again because we werent really getting the outcomes that we wanted from the old outsource contract. The old contract and the old arrangement had both parties not really delivering the intent of that contract; things had become a bit lazy, and things had become quite overpriced as well. Certain outlying items[emdash]such as storage costs, for example[emdash]werent representative of the market, and we were paying millions of dollars in excess of what we should have been paying."
"Was it just the renewal that prompted the bid process?[return]It was a renewal. It was giving us a model of capex versus opex, which we ended up rolling back to, Lets just go for like for like in terms of the renewal; and thats when we put the RFP together[emdash]or, I should say, I put the RFP together.[return][return]So you didnt use a third-party adviser? You put the RFP together?[return]Yes. I didnt get involved in the exigencies and that kind of stuff, but I was pretty much the meat and bones of the actual RFP in terms of services, service levels, etc."
"Its totally new services. We are moving. We are initiating the business in Brazil. We are creating a new branch for the Commerzbank here in South America."
"We are on the brink of letting go of our own data center and implementing a green-field SAP solution within an outsourced data center.[return][return]What was the compelling event that made this necessary right now?[return]The fact that we are a company engaged in midsize takeovers, all on their own platform, with their own ERP systems. We wanted to consolidate everything to a new platform."
"Beginning this year, we acquired enterprise agreements with Oracle; and inside this enterprise agreement, the ULA, we acquired the Oracle Source Suite here: Oracle Business Intelligence, Oracle WebLogic[emdash]we acquired many products from Oracle, and it started many projects. One of these projects is this SOA project, which I am leading."
"I bid almost everything[emdash]everything significant, I bid. When our significant contracts come due, I bid them, unless its[emdash]for instance, I dont rebid my SAP business every six years or whatever, just because its so engrained that it doesnt make a lot of sense."
"One of the primary needs is back-to-core business, and another is quality; I think those are the two primary reasons to do this: quality and back-to-core business. We dont want to do these basic services ourselves; and the current services that we have are not delivering the quality that the business needs. It should deliver a quality increase, and it should deliver a focus on things that we do care about; and that is not commodity[emdash]we dont want to do commodity anymore. We do realize that it is a cost increase because its more expensive to do it, as we calculated; but we dont want to do the commodity ourselves anymore."
"We are not happy with the results from the service in the last years from HP. The satisfaction with HP is not good. We hope for good satisfaction with SAP.[return][return]Is that why you bid these services out?[return]One thing is the price; but the biggest point is the bad communication from and the bad knowledge of the consultants for HP[emdash]a lot of the consultants, not all.[return][return]Can you give some examples of that poor experience?[return]In the past, the consulting company was EDS; and HP bought EDS and fired a lot of people. So we have lost more and more consultants with experience and the remaining consultants that we have in the team are not able to give us a good proposal for some requests. It means[emdash]this is my opinion[emdash]that the consultants use the same solution all the time: We must make a program. We must make some user access. They dont know the new functions in SAP.[return][return]Are there other reasons you decided not to renew with HP?[return]This decision was made as a team, together with the CIO, with my boss, and with colleagues from the purchase department and from IT. We looked at the offers from HP, SAP, and other companies; and we decided that the offer from SAP is, from the viewpoint of the technical solution and the final solution, the best way for the future."
"The current contract with HP, who was the incumbent, was coming due in July, I think it was, of last year. There was a need to go out to market to test the market position of those particular services: pricing, innovation, and all kinds of criteria that we take a look at. Amgen then goes ahead and issues a request for proposal for the services, and we competitively bid them. At the end of the day, we came out with HP as the supplier of choice moving forward for the next three years."
"Findomestic already was an HP client for the same services, but using a different IT architecture. The evolution of the HP service for this new product, on one hand, made us want to upgrade to a better quality product. On the other hand, we had noticed that HP had started to delay the releases of updates for the old architecture; and that was detrimental to us, since it raised costs for all the branches of our firm that had to deploy and install the new packages. That was one of the reasons.[return]     The second point is that Findomestic is trying to validate itself through a tighter model of risk classification and management. That means that all the reports we have to send from now on to the Italian Central Bank[emdash]that is the recipient of the output of this product[emdash]will be unique and more detailed. The previous product could not support either that load of data or the architecture of the new calculation requested by the Bank of Italy. So Findomestic had to make this evaluation, which of course meant to put in competition different suppliers. HP eventually won the bid and got the order."
"We come from a world where we had an internal service provider called Lufthansa Systems, and we recognized that they[emdash]to make the story short[emdash]were no longer able to perform in the right manner in the fast, innovative market of IT infrastructure services. We at Lufthansa had not the intent, and it was not our core business, to invest in that kind of IT infrastructure business anymore. So it was at least a kind of mixture between a portfolio decision and a decision regarding getting right quality of services for the right amount of money."
"The contracts we had up to that point were about to expire, both with Oracle and with IBM, and we decided to unify the services."
"Weve acquired a lot of businesses in the last 10 years and they all have their own ERP system. We wanted to combine those ERP systems in one, and we selected SAP for that. We needed somebody who can host SAP for us."
"Previously answered. [HP is our current provider...of all of our managed services. Our contract was coming up for expiration, and we put out everything for proposal and bid.][return][return]Answered subsequently. [We had gone through a couple of different contracts with HP over the course of 10 years; we were an EDS customer that got acquired by HP, and weve been with HP since they acquired EDS...Because of the complexities of our services and the number of services that we currently get from HP, there was not a one-size-fits-all company out there; we dont actually fit into HPs model either.]"
"We always have major incident management as a service. We were just renewing the contract.[return][return]HP was the incumbent; correct?[return]Correct."
"The contract with T-Systems came to an end, and both parties decided not to renew that contract."
"Basically, with our current supplier, which is Vodafone, we have about 400 servers in total in their data center. The service we get is not bad, but its a bit limited around proper cloud services; we do not deal with public cloud services. Also, its not much consumption-based billing; its more about we pay for the environment, and then we build service on top. Its a very old, traditional method of data hosting. Weve wanted to exploit more modern technology[emdash]especially with public cloud services, which were specifically Amazon and Azure Microsoft."
"EIS officer: Ill take this one. We had implemented an NEC solution back in the early 1980s. The technology architecture was such that it grew organically; so instead of one PBX platform, we have over 11 just supporting the Burbank and site vicinities, which is basically southern California. We needed not only to provide additional functionality to our clientele, but to collapse the infrastructure to try to offset some expenses as it relates to our operational budget. Thats what really prompted the evaluation[emdash]that, and that its at the end of its life cycle as well."
"IT Business Partner: The HR process is learning and training. What we were looking for was an alternative for a learning solution we have currently had running for some years now[emdash]a solution which is more innovative and able to be operated with less effort, for example[emdash]to get the idea whether SaaS makes sense for us to have a better solution than we have currently. We were not in an emergency case, that we had to get rid of it the next day; but there is still a need, or the idea to have another solution, or to have a real alternative. Therefore, we looked whats available on the market; and the Saba solution has a good placement. We found them in the Gartner portfolio as, I think, market leader. The part of the learning process we focused on, I can say, is the WBT campaign management. In general, we can imagine saying, If the solution works well, then well see whether we can increase the amount of the solution portfolio we use; but for this POC, it was focused for campaign management. In effect, its something where we, for Siemens company[emdash]Imagine you have 300,000 employee. These 300,000 employees have to attend certain compliance trainings and certain security trainings to make sure that everybody has the same understanding of not only the idea, but of the needs within our business to handle security issues and to comply with compliance needs of the company. Search for themselves[emdash]thats the process behind that.[return]IT Manager: Maybe also, to give insight, the current solution is possible to enhance some new requirements. The lifetime is already expired for the product; but we know that on the market side, there are a lot of possibilities. For example, uses of Akamai integration of other learning content providers, more external users, mobile experts[emdash]these kinds of functionalities are not available in our existing solution; and it would be a lot of effort to implement that if HR wants this kind of functionality. So there are demands in near future which would be easier to have a third solution which would support this kind of feature; but the current solution has some lacks of innovation on further product roadmaps to achieve. So this is also not only about topics scalability; its also about flexibility or integration to new demands or to new features. So we have no crisis, as mentioned before, that we have to leave the software for. Its something where we look into the market: whether Software as a Service can support the current solution and, of course, give us some value proposition or innovation topics which are not covered at the moment.[return]IT Business Partner: We were highly motivated to find another solution. It was not what you possibly sometimes have with customers who say, Lets have a market check to see where we are at the moment and how we want to proceed with the things we already have. We were really motivated to find another solution, and I think weve come to the reasons why it wasnt HP and Saba at the end. Its less the performance of the tool and the team who presented it to us than the conditions we found in the company, especially  the last month, which have changed a lot now."
"We have a major project that were calling Unity. Our company, through the course of its growth, has grown primarily through acquisition throughout the years. As such, weve inherited several ERP systems along the way, and its come to the point where we want to merge all those together into one system of SAP HANA. Thats what were calling Project Unity."
"The idea was to buy first a platform-as-a-service for our new SAP system. Cloud can be many things, but it was not a public cloud or anything like that. It was platform-as-a-service for our SAP. The needs that we had was to build and operate this new system. Its a greenfield for us.[return]     There were a few reasons we went with a third party. First of all, its a one-time project. We dont believe that we will build another SAP for Teva[emdash]we hope that we dont need to build one in the near future[emdash]so its a one-time project. The second thing is that we needed a high visibility system that was very stable, and we do believe there are companies that can do the work better than ourselves. The third thing is that we at Teva are focused now on many major global programs that will change the way IT is working and also the services that we are providing, and we didnt want to spend or to be focused on this type of activity. We dont see it as our business to build this type of service."
"Previously answered. [GTA, my agency, runs backoffice for most of the other state agencies in Georgia, so its all consolidated. We had outsourced it in 2009; data center services, wide-area network, voice, local-area network[emdash]all of that stuff is outsourced. The incumbents are IBM Global Services, which does all the data center, print, and end-user compute; and AT&T, which does the WAN, LAN, and voice stuff. What was being bid was that we were peeling off part of the IBM scope, which was service desk and all of the cross-functional areas[emdash]all the idle functions such as incident management, problem management, the PMO, the security program, the project office, all of that stuff[emdash]as well as all of the tools, both for running the data center, around event management, and for billing as well. So that was the scope. It was roughly[emdash]the incumbent, IBM, is doing that workload today with about 211 FTEs.][return][return]What was driving that shift in the first place?[return]It was the anticipation that, while weve still got a couple of years to go on the rest of the IBM agreement, were in the process of rebidding the AT&T agreement; and we had decided that, now that were going into the second generation of our sourcing deal, instead of doing one big all-in procurement to just get one vendor to do all telecom services and one vendor to do all data center services, we were going to move to a strategy of actually bidding it by service tower. We were anticipating that we could end up with as many as nine different vendors to manage here, when we get done later this year with the telecom rebid. Then the same thing could happen in 2017 on the IBM side. So part of this was really just preparing for that and getting an independent third party to sit on top of all those service towers and manage it for us."
"At the end, all of the proposals that we[emdash]in the final round, HP, Embratel, and then IBM were selected for the three final companies. Then we started working with those three companies; and technically speaking, all of them met our requests in the process. At the end of the final round that made up the process, it was commercial issues in that process. For all three competitors, we gave them a target; and with the final target, one of them, Embratel, won this process.[return][return]So in the end, it came down to the price?[return]Yes. Also its easy to understand why Embratel[emdash]its an America Movil company. You know the company, right?[return][return]Embratel? Im not as familiar with them.[return]America Movil company [in Mexico]. Probably you know that better.[return][return]What prompted you to outsource these services, to start the whole process in the first place?[return]Not the whole process. We are trying to sustain the stability of SAP; manage inside the warehouse[emdash]our old data warehouse; manage the primary call center for the users here[emdash]what else? We have some activity here. I dont remember exactly, but its part of the new development, the new project, something Ive met; its not in the outsourcing process."
"IThe questionnaire I have filled in does not make very much sense related to the situation we have been in with this purchase.[return][return]Tell me about that. Give me the background on it and so on.[return]The background is that we have, for 12 years now, had an outsourcing contract with IBM covering very many of the services on both set mainframe and the NonStop platform. Now we were in a situation where the contract with IBM was coming to an end, and we have, for a while now in Nordea, been investigating what we wanted to do. One thing for sure was we wanted to take better control. We wanted to be more agile than we felt we had been with the contract we had with IBM. Then, of course, we also wanted a good price for whatever solution we chose, but that was not the main driver. The main driver was the control; secondly the agility; and then the cost, of course, should be okay.[return]     In that situation, we decided that we wanted to take home a core part of what had been outsourced until now. So alternatively we wanted to take it all home. So either we would take home the bigger part[emdash]especially the parts that we believed important for being in control[emdash]and that meant all design authority. It meant all of what is often called middleware or OTP sub-systems. It meant the capacity planning overall. It meant the security parts. What we wanted to leave out was the very base commodity services of hardware, operative system, storage management, and monitoring. So that was one way to go.[return]     The other was to do a fully insourcing of everything, including the hardware and the OS and so on. We ran these tracks in parallel. We ran the full insourcing together with this part outsourcing. The contract was terminating, so we saw it all as an insourcing where we would then investigate and make a new contract with one or two suppliers for the part that we still might want to outsource. That was the scenario.[return]     When there is questions about why we did not choose the insourcing option, yes, but we had actually chosen to insource everything that was important for us to insource. Then it was just a matter of, Do we want to take the full thing, or would we still have the things outsourced that are not so important for us to do ourselves? There we ended up deciding that those areas we had put in scope were not so important for us that we wanted to do the full insourcing. We wanted to have those outsourced. In that situation, we started out with very many potentials on our long list, and on the short list we actually only had IBM, HP and the insourcing option. There we chose to make the contract with IBM for the set platform and make the contract with HP for the NonStop platform.[return][return]So you did end up splitting it between the two.[return]Yes. First of all, we took home two-thirds of the scope for both platforms from IBM, and then we made a contract for the commodity services where we split it between IBM for the set platform and HP for the NonStop platform.[return][return]What part did you keep doing in-house?[return]We brought in-house all the things that would either require or generate any kind of Nordea-specific knowledge, or at least any important kind of Nordea-specific knowledge. Everything about the design of the infrastructure[emdash]the design authority[emdash]that we will be the ones doing the active design. Im not saying that we will not listen to the suppliers, but we will do the design; we will have the design authority in-house. We will be in charge of all infrastructure apart from hardware, operating system, and storage. We will do all the batch planning and scheduling. We will have the suppliers monitor our batch and online and respond, of course, according to instructions and escalate to a second level, which in many cases may be a second level in Nordea. It also means that since our business IT people seldom order anything changed in the operating system, they will not be in direct contact with the supplier. The suppliers will be seen as a subcontractor to Nordeas infrastructure and operations department."
"The initial requirements and desire started off as a risk mitigation exercise around the controls and processes we have in our data centers and the environment across the region. So looking at that, we had a couple things. One was risk; the other was to protect the organization from future growth. Weve had significant growth over the last five years, and we project significant growth over the next five years. So our existing infrastructure needed a bit of a revamp. Otherwise, we believed we would be in a difficult position to support the business in an agile base moving forward. Then lastly, always cost. That goes without saying."
"First off, let me make it clear as to who I am and what my role is. The contract that we spoke to HP about was for a company called PZ Cussons, PZ Cussons is a large consumer packaged goods company thats global. Its is based here in the UK and has a large presence in Africa and in Asia. It has some presence in North America as well. Its very global. Its listed on the Financial Times Stock Exchange in London, so its a private organization and theres probably about 5,000 employees, I think, globally; maybe 6,000 employees globally[emdash]something like that. Now, I actually dont work for PZ Cussons.[return][return]Youre a third-party advisory firm.[return]Thats right. So what we were actually contracting for was an IMS piece of work. What I mean by that was that PZ Cussons is implementing a new SAP ERP solution, and the decision was taken that they didnt want to host that internally. They wanted that to be hosted externally in the cloud by an experienced software provider."
"Infrastructure Manager:[return]All our contracts were going to end in December 2014 so we decided, almost one year earlier, to make a bid. After ten years with the same provider we decided it was time to check the market again to see what opportunities could be available, both for possible new providers and for possible new economical and technological opportunities."
"It was services actually. We had an outsourcing contract that was running out, and we were looking for a different scope. In the process, we chose to shoot out a bid for different offers to see what the different providers could cope with. We were looking for regaining control of some of the services. We were insourcing some of the previously outsourced services and changing the scope compared to the previous outsourcing agreement."
"We already had a facility management contract so we didnt have a specific problem. Weve had a continuous contract for several years so the decision was about continuing the facility management contract."
"We prepare the 20/20 vision, and our objective is to bring the capability for the group to be able to follow[emdash]notably the cloud-ification of Schneider[emdash]because Schneider is a legal proprietor on the IT, and we wanted a very good partner to be able to develop the business."
"We have an outsourced environment today, and the contract was and is expiring, so we chose to go out for a competitive tender for the resourcing of our current contract."
"Mercator as a company has been created as a private equity buyout from Emirates airline, and as such, we are relocating all of the IT and assets out from Emirates airline to our own environments. As part of that, I was brought in to establish new data center environments and internal infrastructure so the company could run standalone away from the Emirates environment."
"In its simplest form, it was a vitality exercise. Our contract with HP had first been signed in 1997, and we had continued that relationship with HP over about 17 years through a series of contract extensions. However, at this point, we felt that we had reached a point where we really couldnt enter into another contract extension with HP. It was time to renew the relationship and renew the agreement. HP had done well over those years; otherwise we wouldnt have stayed with them that long. However, we felt that a procurement exercise was due. Now when I say it was a vitality exercise, thats true, but it also gave us the opportunity to make ourselves more audit compliant. There were some things about the older infrastructure that fell short of our audit requirements, so that was an opportunity to fix that up. Also, of course, it was an opportunity to introduce some innovative new services, so it addressed our innovation objectives as well."
"It was just that Aimia as a company has grown through acquisitions, and we came to a point where the infrastructure that we supported required some streamlining. We operate in all four global regions, so Asia-Pacific, Europe, Canada, and the US. We have four regions and we have 42 data centers thanks to the number of acquisitions we made. The plan is to streamline these. We were also looking for a strategic partner that would help us innovate, help us with best-of-breed processes. Were a loyalty and marketing company highly leveraged by technology, so we wanted to ensure that we picked a good partner that would help us in our journey forward."
"We had it in the past. Most of the service for our CPD is already in our sourcing, but we were using several contracts with different providers, so it was very tough to manage the relationships between all the contracts. What we wanted with this contract was to consolidate all the services into only one provider, to probably get the best cost deal to the synergies between the different contracts, and due to the volume, reducing the volume to give us the best prices for the services. It was also to reduce the complexity and the time we needed to manage all the ecosystems of design providers regarding the CPD. We had the CPD outsourced, and we had the contract for the housing. We had a contract for the system administration. We had a contract for communications. We had several contracts. In the past, we also had all the infrastructure that was owned by Correos. We made a conversion in all the hardware systems, and with this contract we avoided doing investments for the future. We wanted this service model in which is also included investments. We needed also with this contract to renew all of our infrastructure. It was the time to decide to consolidate because we had to face up the renewal of most of all the infrastructure in the CPDs."
"The salesperson said that this bid process is referred to as Rabbit. Is that correct?[return]Right. Yes.[return][return]Can you give me the background on the business needs that prompted this purchase process?[return]There were two principle needs. The first one was a need to transform our current infrastructure platform to a refreshed or renewed technology platform, which leads to a number of value propositions toward our customers. The second was the need for a lower operating cost structure. It is our view that both of those objectives were targeted by the process."
"It was a separation between two companies, and we need to build up the infrastructure and location to host the systems which should be separated."
"We are implementing the SAP application systems across our chemicals business. We had a SAP hosting agreement with HP that expires in January of 2016."
"HP actually hosts our SAP environment now for one of our business units, and we are doing a large expansion of our SAP environment across an entire division. The original contract with HP was actually transferred from an acquisition, and it was expiring. We went to HP directly to try to get them to extend the contract and to keep the terms similar. They tried to double the price and do all kinds of other nasty things to us. That forced us to go to bid."
"Weve had a long-term partnership with HP. Actually since 1999 theyve been taking care of this contract, and the reason behind the sourcing now was actually the contract with HP ends in February 2016. Apart from that I will also say that we are looking for a  more proactive and more strategic-oriented partner which also could cover more of the application development, application maintenance areas and not just being part of a contract agreement with HP so far. We have a replacement for the work that has been done by HP for us. Also, we want a more strategic partner where we want to increase the footprint and make sure we have a partner which can help us out both in innovation and capacity within different areas, could be infrastructure, but also applications."
"Was this a replacement of an existing service provider?[return]No, we are developing it from the beginning. We did not have a solution in Internet banking. We are a little company[emdash]a credit cooperative[emdash]and we do not have Internet banking yet. This will be the first provision of this service.[return][return]Why did you decide that you wanted Internet banking? Was that a strategic objective?[return]Its the mobile explosion of using it, mainly from the young people. Our clients started to discuss this lack as a comparative; they discussed this as a freedom, as a democracy-like banking. They discussed, they defined, and the need came to IT to have solutions for that. Two years ago, this began to be a priority; so we started to manage the solutioning six or seven months ago."
"Actually, its for our entire outsourcing service. We have outsourced our credit card system to HP for about twenty years now. We have always had a need for this outsourcing service. At this time, we were trying to see if there are better vendors for the same service in the market."
"The company historically has been observing the IT as a cost and it had significantly kept the core investments very, very low for, I would say, eight to ten years. About eight years back the company went for implementing SAP and after that it has not leveraged that for me, and also has gone beyond in various other facets of leveraging IT capability of operation supply chain or digital business intelligence. As a result the company is lagging very significantly with respect to its deals in the e-marketplace. There is a huge amount of catch-up which needs to be done in the company, from establishing the very basics to be in order. The entire vision to realize is we have set forth about 80-odd projects over the next five or six years, and for all of that infrastructure is the foundation. If you are to ask me how the last one and a half, two years since Ive moved into this company, there has been a huge amount of effort in changing the mindset of the board from looking at IT as a cost[emdash]instead of looking at IT as a cost to look at it as an investment opportunity[emdash]and make them realize that it has huge return on investment capability. This is one of the very basic essential foundations for the road map was to begin in terms of infrastructure. This is one first and very significant step in the direction of realizing the companys vision."
"The costs, the delivery model, and the service quality were all not to our happiness. The contract ended, so we did not prolong the contract. We definitely started looking for a new, more modern, flexible, cost-effective, high-quality service provider.[return][return]Who was the incumbent provider?[return]Im too sure whether I am allowed to disclose that one."
"The trigger was to increase the SLAs and the quality of service that we have currently. Another trigger was the provisioning. Its supposed to be easier: the provisioning[emdash]and the costs are good for us also.[return][return]Before you even started looking at other vendors, you were looking for savings.[return]Yes, we tried to compare all. One factor was the support and maintenance. The support and maintenance right now is provided by HP from Spain for that infrastructure, so HP has a greater knowledge of our needs than the others. It was easier to decide.[return][return]So you needed better knowledge, efficiency, and cost savings. Was there an advantage on cost with HP, or were they all close?[return]No. It was close but when we evaluated the technical side and cost of change, HP definitely is better because the cost of change for the others will be very higher[emdash]and for us also."
"Procurement Consultant: Link Group acquired Superpartners last year and essentially, as an organization, has increased in size significantly. This is an opportunity with obviously now multiple suppliers, and this is an opportunity to consolidate in terms of supply. That was the main driver.[return][return]You said that you were looking at consolidating or if that didnt work out you would have a couple of providers. Did you end up being able to consolidate to one, or did you end up choosing a couple?[return]Procurement Consultant: At the end we decided to go with one supplier[emdash]one managed service provider. Theres a lot of efficiency you gain from that, by dealing with one supplier as opposed to many, and we were comfortable that the supplier we selected had the skills and experience we required across those towers, except for one tower which we carved out. Then that one we are still in the process of negotiation in terms of utilizing a specialist provider. Theres one area that we werent comfortable that the preferred respondent had that extra skill set. In fact HP never even responded on that tower, so it is a very specialist area and were still in the process of negotiating that tower. I wont go into detail with that because its still very sensitive and confidential."
"Prior to the bid process, we had HP delivering infrastructure services to us, which is everything up to the operating system. We had TCS, IBM, and Ericssons own service company called BUGS[emdash]which is an unfortunate acronym for an IT company, but its Business Unit Global Services[emdash]and the contracts were coming to an end. So, we wanted to re-contract for these services, and we only brought our incumbent vendors into the bidding.[return]     At the same time, we wanted to make some improvements to the services themselves and to transform how we did certain things; for example, in the HP case, moving much more to a cloud-based infrastructure. We wanted to push more responsibility and accountability over to our suppliers. Some of the things that we are currently doing internally from a technical design standpoint, etc., we wanted to push over to the suppliers and put more responsibility and accountability on them.[return]     Then of course there was cost cutting, to be honest. We needed to drive down our costs, and so what we did through this process was basically say to our suppliers, Look, these are our financial goals. Get creative and tell us, based on your best practices and what you know about us, the best way to do this. From an Ericsson standpoint, it was quite different than how it had been done in the past. In the past it was like Ericsson would put out an RFP and say, This is what we want you to do. Comply, no comply, and give us our price. In this case we said, Look, these are our objectives. Tell us what you think the best way to achieve those objectives is."
"We have nowadays an Ericsson solution working in our network. We need to deploy a new one because the Ericsson one is not a very modern one, so we need a more reliable solution. We need to be more strong than the actual solution is. We decided to change our system. Also, we have to have all the new functionality to manage the LTE new clients and so on.[return][return]<i>Additional information provided in writing.[return]</i>Change our mobile HRL platform in order to make it more robust and support LTE technology."
"The purchase was for a unified database for HLR and HSF.[return][return]Were you replacing those? Are they new?[return]It was a replacement to add redundancy to the network. The current equipment is Ericsson, and its not geographically secured, so one of the first drivers was to secure it, and the second driver was to evolve to a unified database."
"We were looking for new services. What we looked for in this RFP process was to control the cost of the project and for a provider with very good knowledge of the infrastructure, services, and the experience to manage this project. We invited different big providers from the industry. Of course, HP had a very high score in terms of experience because they were the ones involved for the past three years. HP was very highly ranked on this, but we wanted to look for different options from providers in terms of having the cost of the project very well controlled. The final decision took into consideration these main issues: the cost of the project, maintaining the same knowledge of the services and the infrastructure associated, and maintaining the quality of services we have had in the past."
"The reason is to actually guarantee a high reliability.[return][return]Did you previously have another vendor providing those services?[return]No. Thats why we actually did an RFP and a new bid.[return][return]Who was the next closest vendor to HP?[return]Huawei, Ericsson, and Nokia as well.[return][return]Which one of those three was in second place behind HP?[return]Nokia."
"As a telecommunications service provider, we are trying to increase our customer loyalty and increase our service revenues. Currently, we offer some cloud products for this; but we have some manual processes. Every product has a little different buying and management process, with multiple user names and passwords, and its making it difficult for our customers. We wanted to aggregate these on a single platform with some kind of online purchasing and online management and close to real-time capabilities so that we can make it easier for our customers to purchase and manage cloud products. Thats why we wanted to buy a cloud service broker. We investigated some other alternatives, and we decided to go with HP on this."
"My understanding is this was for an SMS-C replacement. Do I have that right?[return]Yes. The project is an SMS-C replacement. That means that currently our company has been running the services a long time since the event of the SMS service. The company runs an implementation from Acision. Previously Acision was called Logica, and previously again that company was called CMG. This is the story.[return]     We arrived at this time because our department tried to convince our management that we can do the same SMS services with lesser cost. This is the story. We were able together with HP people to demonstrate this common answer. However, one very important part of the project is the SMS-C replacement. Another part is called TGDS consolidation. GDS is an acronym of our own platform based on nonstop servers that we develop since the beginning of 2000 more or less; so 14 years where we developed only internally. There is a phase that we must reach for the end of the next year, and this is a consolidation project; so close all the nonstop servers and move more or less 10 services that run on that old server onto the new machines.[return][return]Were you also considering doing this work internally using your own resources?[return]In fact, in this project HP sells the hardware[emdash]the nonstop server and the operating systems of the server[emdash]sells to Telecom Italia, and we work together to discover an answer. But all the application software[emdash]all the services that run the software of the HP product[emdash]are owned by Telecom Italia. It is developed by us. It is our own product. So yes, the application, SMS-C, is our own. There is another parallel story in which HP has in its portfolio this product, and HP can sell this software product inside its portfolio.[return][return]To your customers.[return]Yes. In that case, we are the vendor and HP is the customer in that case. For our product, lets say half is done by HP: the hardware, the operating system, etc. The other half is our own software."
"The business needs were not very clear[emdash]in fact, that was the most problematic part for the technical team. It was the infrastructure service on the basic side[emdash]the primary side[emdash]and then some Software as a Service for the SME segment. Then they added the enterprise segment also for the whole platform. So the basic need was just around SaaS and IS in the first phase; and then in the second and support phases we started to impact the CRM and the billing integration[emdash]add more services to run the product catalog on Vodafones CRM site. The first phase is basically to run the system with minimum investment and as quickly as possible."
"It was business requirements and some lender meetings. Business is going to Cloud; business process operators are also hatching Cloud business, or we were looking for fortunate uses for Cloud. In the end, we decided to go for an RFI and RFQ process. For this reason, we started off this RFQ process and selected HP at the end."
"It was innovation. It was more focused on innovation to investigate all the new solutions on the market."
"We had two needs: one to reduce costs for the purchase, and the other to improve the delivery of these services."
"We had to negotiate, and we heard about this new analytic company; and we are looking for some system that can oversee and control the whole telecom network for our company."
"We had some obsolete technology in the HR area, so we faced some necessity to renew the technology. This was the reason we started the tendering process for this UDR solution. Also, we are going to implement Voice Over IP of the servicing of our network, and UDR implementation is the mandatory condition to LOS[emdash]to launch Voice Over IP service."
"An evolution of the platform."
"Basically, it was technological evolution of the HLR. We wanted to enable and simplify the deployment of new services such as VoIP pack, Wi-Fi, etc."
"You recently considered HP for your voice mail system for the southern hub; correct?[return]Yes, thats correct.[return][return]What were the business needs?[return]The initial scope was voice mail. During the RFQ process, we expanded the scope of such a need. We expanded it to all the messaging platforms: to SMS, to MMS, to all the messaging platforms that we have[emdash]vertical platforms here in the local markets. The requirement was, Please provide a platform; please provide me a product, having all the messaging capability and being convergent in a single platform. I want a platform from you which can manage voice mails and all the stuff on the same platform, and give me a product and a roadmap."
"The business need is that we needed to replace the current IVR platform that we have in Argentina, and in other countries as well, because this platform is in end of life. So we need to replace it, and this was the business need.[return][return]Which system was reaching end of life?[return]You mean the vendor?[return][return]Yes.[return]The traditional vendor was Ericsson."
"My understanding is that this was for a single sign-on solution that HP was selected for.[return]Thats right.[return][return]The idea of this purchase is to have only one user and password for all our services per user. Right now, the user needs to remember many password, many usernames, and many things to access a specific application. So in some cases its the email; in some cases its the [indecipherable at 2:14]; in some cases they have only one password, and in some cases they have many. So the idea is to have only one way to access this service."
"We started the process between Telcordia, NetCracker and Amdocs. Those were the three options. At that time, HP was supporting Telcordia. The process took[emdash]believe it or not[emdash]three years, more or less. So during that time, HP Telcordia was bought by Ericsson, so HP do not compete in the three[emdash]it wasnt an option for us because HP did not have an inventory system in that time.[return]     We kept advancing with the process. We got rid of Telcordia and kept only two options: Amdocs and NetCracker. Then we decided that the best option was NetCracker. In that time HP wasnt in the picture, but negotiations with NetCracker took at least eight months. At some times, it looked like we wouldnt reach an agreement with NetCracker.[return]     Then I heard from HP that HP had bought a system[emdash]I believe its called Trueview[emdash]its an inventory system that HP bought recently. So I asked HP to give me a presentation. I asked to do a [indecipherable at 2:59] in Colombia, and then we started the process of negotiation, but this permitted us to close with NetCracker. When NetCracker saw that we had another option on the table, they yielded to the demands we made, and we closed the deal with them.[return]     So it was not a matter of whether HP did something well or not, to be honest. We had already chosen NetCracker for our inventory system. The negotiation was hard. The legal part was hard, but we closed with them and not for HP because we always wanted NetCracker."
"This project is mainly focused on expansion of the current platform, because we need web capacity on the current platform that in the past was delivered by [indecipherable at 07:07] with Italtel system integration. We are also focusing on finding a cheaper solution with some more features that we have today in field. The two main drivers have been economics and capacity; so we can summarize in having expansion of the current platform with a cheaper per-user cost with possibly new features that we need. The solution is mainly focused on business customers for a subscription service[emdash]so integrated with the customer as their IT [indecipherable at 8:24], and they wont integrate with the current VoIP provider. The more of the solution that connect the provider is flexible, the best and the quickest will be doing integration. For this reason, we look at the solution that will give us the maximum flexibility on the cost side."
"Our need was improve our network capacity. Our current Unigate network is in an end-of-support state, so we have to purchase new solutions to replace the old one. We decided to purchase the Oracle solution, so this was our need and our choice."
"We have to monitor our network that delivers services based on data. We are a tier one mobile operator in Italy, and we are dealing with delivering the best quality to all of our customers; so we were interested in purchasing new operations systems for the monitoring of data traffic."
"I think this is about the HP hardware that we purchased [indecipherable at 1:27].[return][return]Did you say the Hadoop?[return]Hadoop is the application that we install, but what we purchased from HP is only the hardware portion.[return][return]Right. This is specifically about your decision not to use HP for the services part of this.[return]Yes, because we already got the software from a different deal, so we just need to have the hardware. But the thing about Hadoop is we wanted to have an open installation, so we didnt prefer the other vendor, because if we go to their hardware specification it will not be open; and we know that the market leader is somebody else. The software that we purchase is from the market leader. So that we have the flexibility in future, we decided on HP hardware so we can change the solution in future.[return][return]So it is HP hardware, but who is delivering the services on it?[return]We have two vendors, two partners who are responsible for the installation and services.[return][return]Can you share who they are?[return]I can share what the product is that we purchased. This is on the IBM. IBM got the solution, the software, so we decided for that.[return][return]Are they also delivering the services on the installation?[return]Them and their local partners. Basically they are the principal for everything, and they have local partners. Interestingly, the person who is their partner for this installation also partners with HP to deliver the hardware. So we got a partner for the hardware, who is also the partner with IBM for the software. So that partner generally will partner with anybody, whatever the concern."
"We have to replace end-of-life equipment."
"[indecipherable at 1:47] operation and has an ONC. The major application thats used to monitor and maintain the network is the network management system."
"Basically they are developments in the market. We have to offer the services to our customers because everyone else is doing it."
"The deal we are talking about was related to system integration activities for network function virtualization. One of the main points of these activities was to select a system integrator for what we have called Wave Zero of network function virtualization, in which we ask the possible system integrator to supply three things: (1) support in terms of system integration and knowledge of end-to-end delivery process with respect to the operation of the Telecom Italia process, (2) previous experience in NFV and Telecom Italia transformation process, or to prove they already accomplished a transformation project of a similar dimension and complexity as ours at Telecom Italia; and (3) the independence of the system integrator from any particular technological solution[emdash]or being technology agnostic to avoid lock-in[emdash]and to support us through the technology and the selection for the next wave of activities, with technology that may be different from the evolution of the specific product of the vendor.[return]     The last is an important point, because these points of independence from a vendors technological solution is one of the points which we found, for example, that HP was less in line with our requirements. When we asked them to give us, for example, ideas or vision on the transformation of our company related to the NFV, sometimes they gave us their product roadmap[emdash]it was, rather, the intention of this specific tender to get specific counsel[emdash]instead of giving us some answer related to the transformation. The profile of the system integrator was to select a partner in order to start with us the transformation that was requested by NFV. So, the independence from the technology[emdash]that could be third-party technology; HP or not HP[emdash]was one of the points that we stressed in this selection. [return]     Then the tender brought together engineering and operational requests, so there were a lot of areas in which each prospective system integrator had to give us an answer. This was a very specific tender also compared to the questions that were present in the questionnaire, where the system integration dimension and the technological dimension were merged each other."
"The specific deal that this was driven from was the mainframe services RFP that we put out."
"We are subcontracting most of our models at this time. We subcontract the majority of our activities for our server operations. We wish to reduce those operational costs by introducing a new model of activities around the activity model of cloud computing. Therefore, we have launched this action in the first place to reduce the cost and to also create more agility and flexibility among our services. We do believe that the model of IT subcontracting will tend to go forward. Thats the reason why we wanted to try to experiment and foresee any dis-approach."
"AbbVie was formed as a result of a spinoff from Abbott, and  as part of the spinoff, Abbott did not give AbbVie any IT infrastructure  to speak of. So AbbVie is having to build brand new IT infrastructure  from scratch in order to support the server compute load  that is going to be migrated out of Abbott. 80 to 90 percent of the  server environment is all brand new that HP is going to install. The  problem they were solving was getting off of their transition service  agreement onto their own IT services."
"Together with HP, we did a request for proposal where we actually went in and asked for data center consolidation.[return][return]What were the reasons behind wanting to do that consolidation?[return]Today we have a decentralized setup. Wed like to combine that in three data centers: one in Europe, one in America, and one in Asia-Pacific.[return][return]Are there anticipated cost savings and efficiencies from that?[return]You can take all of those good marketing words and phrase them, but for us, its more to bring Kaba IT to the next level, or the next generation. This is my goal."
"The company has offered a separation package in an effort to reduce payroll. We had a number of people in our area take the package, so we were looking for vendors to provide managed services[emdash]not to supplement, but to replace areas where we had lost too many people to be able to support."
"FedEx is going through a restructuring program. They are trying to take out cost. They had a voluntary buyout. A lot of the IT staff took advantage of that, so they needed to supplement their remaining workforce."
"Do you know what a smart electricity meter is? There is a government commitment in Great Britain that by the year 2020, every home in Great Britain will have a a smart electricity meter and a smart gas meter installed. In Great Britain, there is basically a competitive market for energy supply, so as a consumer you can get your electricity from one of several different suppliers, and the government wants that market to work very easily. It should be really easy to switch suppliers.[return]     When you have got a smart meter, if you want to switch suppliers, you shouldnt need to get a new meter. What the government decided to do is to buy the communications infrastructure that all the smart meters would use to connect the meters in peoples homes with energy suppliers. Basically the government set up this infrastructure a bit like the public telephone network effectively, and then the industry would use it rather than all going and buying their own arrangements, which would mean them all doing the same things. It would be very costly and duplicate lots of cost."
"AbbVie separated from Abbott at the beginning of the year. As you can imagine, we have a lot of IT infrastructure separation activities that are required to fully separate from Abbott, because we are now a standalone, fully functioning company. The separation from Abbott is really what drove the requirement to look at data center managed services. We were not going to build an organization, nor did we have facilities for our own data center. A lot of it was speed, and then running data centers isnt our core competency. Its creating medicines to cure illnesses."
"We wanted this piece of work to be done outsourced effectively rather than us doing it in-house. We thought it was the best solution.[return][return]Is this a replacement of a solution you already had in place?[return]Specifically, we are closing down a business, and as part of the closing down of the business, we need to retain some of the data[emdash]the information for that business[emdash]and make sure that we have access to it and it is available to us for typically a minimum of seven years. We have obligations to retain data with this legacy business, which we are closing down. We had to work out how best to do that. There are legacy systems at this business, which we need to think what is the best way for us to keep those live and the data available for six or seven years. The option we decided was to have a third party do that for us, host it for us, and support it for us."
"Life-cycle requirements, existing services are aging, and future demand growth."
"It was a government decision to install smart meters across all of Great Britain. As a result of that policy decision, they needed to get external service providers to provide the data services package of that part of the deal to make sure that service questions taken from service users were processed down to smart meters.  Resulting commands were sent back from the smart meter processor and sent back to service users."
"We own a loan servicer that we are winding down the business for. We needed to keep a portion of the data and applications readily accessible for ongoing requests.[return][return]For a certain period of time until that isnt required anymore?[return]Correct."
"Previously answered. [This is separating Abbvies infrastructure from the Abbott infrastructure to support the creation of a new company.][return][return]Is that separation what prompted the need for this purchase?[return]Yes."
"It was something that was being planned for about five or six years, so well before I started with Takeda. I joined in December 2012. About five or six years ago when the sourcing agreement was made with HP on the infrastructure part, there were other services that were being sourced with individual best-of-breed service providers. It led us to an environment in which we had about six major service providers and about 15 smaller ones. You can imagine then the complexity of the service provider landscapes. With all of those contracts coming and because of the continuous transition and transformation that the company underwent dating back from 2007 onward, there was a vision to try to co-terminate all of the contracts[emdash]or get them to expire as close as possible[emdash]to see if there was an opportunity in the market to go out and establish a wider service provider landscape with more services; to consolidate mature services into one or a few service providers and reduce the service provider landscape that way.[return][return]It looks like you ended up going down to three vendors. Have I got that correct?[return]Yes, that is correct. We do not have a strategy of going single sourcing, nor do we have an outspoken strategy for remotely sourcing. What we did say is that we have a suite of services within the infrastructure[emdash]anything basically from end-user provisioning service desks, etc., spanning across 65 different countries. It is a fairly complex beast for a single service provider, or at least it can be. What we put as our yardstick was we tried to bundle the services that we have as logically as possible. We ended up with five different bundles of services, one being the end-user centric part. Then you have the commoditized mail and SharePoint services. You have an element around side services and provisioning of remote access. You have SAP as a service stack, and then you have the traditionally-based data center services of business application hosting to the far right. So there are these five services, within each of their service stack, if you like.[return]     With the help of our external consultants, we probed the maturity in the market to see if our own thinking was in line with how the business was adjusting themselves to deliver services, where they would be completely off, or where they would actually be well received. We chose to go with the five bundles with an expectation because of the accelerated pace we wanted to run the process with, only to end up with a maximum of five across all bundles and no more than three service providers per bundle. This was simply just to maximize the through-put of the process and to ensure that we could run the process in an accelerated fashion. We anticipated to be able to run it within anywhere between 7 and 12 months.[return][return]Within those five bundles, you wanted to have no more than three providers. Do I understand that correctly?[return]Yes. For each of the bundles, no more than three service providers. That is where we down-selected, but as a total, to no more than five; because what we did was also in the political landscape that we are in with Takeda[emdash]as any organization that has a full IT organization[emdash]obviously there is a keen interest in what we are doing. We wanted to make sure that we safeguarded the interests of our Japanese and American VIPs. We looked at their current incumbency and if they would fit into the CCO landscape, so that we are not creating an island within the company but are safeguarding the entire IT journey within Takeda. That in itself, plus the availability of service providers of the geographical footprint we are looking for, already set a pace of how many service providers we could invite in.[return]     We wanted to invite HP in because they were our incumbent. They had proven their delivery in the past. There were other service providers in other regions that we wanted to take in[emdash]other incumbents that we wanted to explore the opportunity for[emdash]and we ended up with a field of 10 service providers going into the process. You have to see that in that view of looking at no more than five across the bundles and no more than three within each bundle as the down-select target.[return][return]Did all of the providers bid on all of the bundles?[return]No. There was a variety. That spanned from single bundle to five bundles, with the majority of the service providers actually bidding four or five, so that was more than half of them.[return][return]These three you listed as undisclosed that were selected are delivering the services needed across the five bundles. Is that correct?[return]That is correct, yes.[return][return]I want to make sure I can differentiate between the three undisclosed vendors.[return]I cant actually name them, but I think that by rule of exclusion, you should be able to name them yourself. Actually, it ended up being a very interesting scenario, and I have no problem disclosing that the three providers have actually bid across all five bundles. We ended up in a scenario in which we had very strong candidates from the Asia-Pac region, from the maturing Indian providers, and also an American-based service provider. If you can imagine that in our geographical footprint, and being Takeda globally, that actually fits like a glove into the political landscape that we navigate in."
"For several years, we have outsourced our SAP hosting operations. The contract needed to renew, and we decided to go for a tender."
"HP had been providing support for infrastructure hosting. It was originally EDS when Meritor first outsourced that activity. We had been in that relationship for six years. I think we extended it one additional year to do some further analysis, etc., and then we decided that it would be prudent given seven years with that arrangement to test the market so to speak, so we went out with a formal RFP process. Then ultimately, based on the analysis of those RFPs, we decided it made sense to go a different path and ultimately selected AT&T on the infrastructure hosting deal.[return]     One of the motivational factors is certainly the ability to save money in this area, as well as the application support area, so that we could reinvest those savings in funding some other necessary transformation. That was also central to driving why we went down this path. So similar dynamics in the application service space. In the application support area, we had had a relationship for about 10 years with HCL. The model was not managed services. It was more of a staff augmentation type of a support model. We did want to go to the next level or step in that type of relationship, so we were looking to move the application support to a managed services model.[return]     Similar to what we did on the infrastructure side, we went out with a formal RFP to a number of different firms related to providing that support. Based on the analysis of those responses, there were a couple things that influenced our decision. Clearly the RFP responses were an important piece, but probably equally as so was once we decided that we were going to move providers in terms of infrastructure hosting, that made us far more uncomfortable with also moving providers on the application support side of things. We decided ultimately to stay with HCL and transition from the staff augmentation support model to a managed services model. We were not comfortable going through that transition with a completely new provider in that space after we had decided to move on the infrastructure."
"We were renewing our contract that was about to expire. We were renewing with a new provider."
"Let me give you a little bit of background. Maybe this will help frame it up. We issued the RFP at least one year ago. We had several players. We down-selected to two: HP and a competitor, HCL. IBM was not. We worked that RFP through the spring, summer, and fall of 2013. Then we went into a pause mode due to some internal approval processes.[return]     We came out of 2013 into 2014, and just a couple of weeks ago, we had a call with some of the senior team at HP and informed them that although we hadnt made a final decision[emdash]and we still havent I might add[emdash]were leaning strongly to a competing supplier, HCL. As we informed Pat Vondette and the rest of the team[emdash]most of whom we here at that meeting a couple of weeks ago[emdash]that was our direction. Not a whole lot has changed since then. We havent formally given notice to HP that were exiting, but were leaning strongly to the competitor as the solution.[return]     For the last six or seven years, HP has been our data center hosting and hardware services provider for Mexico, Latin America, parts of Europe, and most of our AMEA, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific Region. This particular RFP is taking that work, plus everything that PepsiCo does for themselves in the US, plus we have other data centers that we host ourselves[emdash]we run ourselves[emdash]in parts of Europe and other parts of the world. Its bringing all the data center work in under one umbrella and then awarding that business. The numbers, if you will, that HP was supporting in the past on a server-based metric was roughly a third of what were actually sourcing. So its bigger in that regard."
"We were pretty fragmented with our infrastructure services in the international market. We had a mixture of doing it with HP and doing it with our own local people. It was probably about two-thirds HP and one-third PepsiCo associates. In our domestic markets here in the US, we ran it with our own people. We wanted to move away from a fragmented operation with too many locations, too much equipment, and non-standard equipment and manual processes; to more of an automated process with a common source of supply, and to build agility into our infrastructure services."
"We have an existing outsourcing agreement with a provider that is coming to term. This purchase process was part of our process to decide what our plan is for the dealing with that situation."
"The incumbent had a lot of issues. The incumbent wasnt providing the level of services we required. It had been a five-year effort to look at where we are in this journey, and we decided about last spring to see what our options were in an RFP process. We did an RFI, we did an RFP, and that is where we are."
"Gas Natural Fenosa is the result of the merger of two companies: Gas Natural and Union Fenosa. We merged in 2009. Each company had different vendors[emdash]different companies that were providing the operation services for IT. HP was providing the services to Gas Natural, and another company[emdash]Indra[emdash]was providing the services for Union Fenosa. So, during the last four or five years, we had both companies providing the services. We tried to match the services, and finally, HP got the whole contract. One year ago, we decided to bid the services for the coming seven years."
"It was a need for PepsiCo to move to a new service-based approach and to drive standardization and consolidation through our landscape. We are moving from a holding company to an operating company, so basically from a collection of decentralized business units to an integrated operating model. We didnt think that we could do that as efficiently or as effectively without partnering with someone who is an expert in the space."
"There were two things. One was that original HP agreement was coming to term for our international business units. Secondly, we took a look at ourselves globally and recognized that there were lots of opportunities for improvement either operationally, or on a technical platform basis. That is what started the development of the strategy, which ultimately led to the RFP process."
"The specific purpose of this job was to maintain old infrastructure belonging to Gas Natural, and to operate and maintain the servers, storage, communication elements, software, operating systems, databases, and so on.[return][return]Were you consolidating all of that into one provider, or were you trying to replace a provider?[return]Perhaps it is important. Let me explain the situation of the company. Four years ago, Gas Natural was the only gas company in Spain and in other Latin American countries. In 2009, Gas Natural took over Union Fenosa, an electricity company also based in Spain. During the last three years we have merged both companies. Now the new company is Gas Natural Fenosa, but it comes from two different companies: one gas and the other an electricity distribution company.[return]     When we decided to merge both companies, we also decided to have the same processes across the company in all business, not only in IT. We decided to manage customers, to manage channels, and to manage everything in the same way. Concerning IT, we decided to manage all the application and all the infrastructure in the same way. In 2009 we had two different suppliers operating the infrastructure, HP and Indra, because they were the former suppliers of each company. In 2012, we decided to forget Indra, move Indra out of this specific area, and we decided to offer it to HP. We decided to trust in HP as the only supplier for the operation of all the infrastructure in Gas Natural Fenosa in 2012, more or less in June 2012.[return]     We advised HP in 2012, Sirs, be careful because we have decided to sign a new contract with you for 18 months, so until December 2013. What we weigh in this period, you to be aware that in the end of 2013 we want a new service, and we will put this offer into the market. So please be careful that your contract is finished in 2013. Yes, yes, yes. Dont worry. So that HP understands our context, what we want at the company level[emdash]not only in infrastructure, not only in IT, but at the company level[emdash]what we want is not only one supplier in one service. We want two or three suppliers for the same service to have the capability to transfer services if one supplier is failing, or to be able to absorb more jobs if we have a peak or we have an overload. Our spirit at the company level is to have several suppliers for several services. We dont like to have only one supplier and one service and to be 100 percent dependent on it. To answer your question, what we have decided is not to change HP with another supplier, but to add more competitors so we will have the possibility to make transfers and to have internal competencies."
"I think the contract has been running for eight years. It is time for a rebid. It is part of our procurement process. The contract has run its term."
"We started in August of 2013. We are in a start-up situation. We started operating in the Brazilian market as a bank, and we intend to grow very very fast. It is important to have an IT partner to support all the services in terms of infrastructure: I mean data center hosting and technology services as a whole, field services, technical support, and so on. We intend to grow very fast. In this situation, it is important to develop the relationship with an IT partner that will support us during that time. At first we are very small compared to the other players in the market, but we intend to grow very fast. The primary purpose of the proposal process was to find an IT partner to help us to grow."
"There were two big things. We were getting ready to move data centers, so basically move out of the HP facilities and move out of our existing internally hosted data centers; to combine and go into two new data centers that were a co-lo scenario. That project is going on right now. We are getting into a position to figure out what our expense is going to be as we had this double capacity. The second reason was that we can save money, but the primary reason was the data center effort."
"Answered subsequently. [We obviously wanted them to have a certain amount of authorization to  the network components, and while we have been talking to HP over the  last number of months[emdash]probably a year[emdash]they never showed any flexibility  in that area. They said, No, no. This must be done by us. We cant give  you that access. As a result of those discussions, we then went to  market and we went into tender. Then all of a sudden, their approach  changed and they could become more flexible. That didnt actually go  down well with people. We want to see the flexibility when we start  talking, not because they are under pressure.]"
"It looks like you are purchasing a combination of infrastructure and app management services. Is that correct?[return]Yes. It is basically managed services of the infrastructure and the apps. The tools and the infrastructure are owned by us, and the managing and maintaining the SLAs is provided by the service provider."
"The customer wants to go to a multi-sourcing approach from a strategic point of view and selected the LAN service as the first service he wants to tender. The current provider basically also decided not to compete."
"The back story is that we had a 10 year agreement with HP. It would have expired in May of this year, so we went to market and looked at replacing, or at the minimum, improving on what we had in place.[return][return]Were there leanings internally to renew, or were there leanings in the other direction to find something else?[return]We were fervently of the belief that we were going to sell them out.[return][return]What had happened to cause that type of a sentiment?[return]I think it was a general feeling of malaise where our folks thought that HP was not aggressively or intelligently managing the account, but rather were treating us like just another client. There was not a lot of thought leadership coming in. The day-to-day performance was okay, but there was far too much of a reliance on, It is not in the contract. It is not in the contract. It is not in the contract. Trying to milk additional funds out of a longstanding relationship. There were some questions about overall performance. There had been some failures where it seemed like HP had taken their eye off the ball, and there were questions about, Should that be happening or shouldnt it?. Maybe it is time to get somebody new in here. We think we are paying too much. All those sorts of things.[return][return]How close did TCS get to taking the business away from HP?[return]Quite close.  If there wasnt a hurdle of switching costs, we probably would have  gone down that path. In the end, HP came in and actually did a good job  of winning the deal."
"ISD LATAM: This is an initiative that we are leading from ISD LATAM. ISD is IT. It is mainly based in operational efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives. That is the main background of why we needed this project."
"End of contract with HP.[return][return]Is it standard due diligence to go through a process like this, or was there anything else driving it?[return]Originally there was a big global strategic effort that coincided with the end of the contract. Thats what started it.[return][return]What was the objective of that strategic effort that was going on?[return]To develop a global data center and hosting services strategy."
"Who would you have considered to be the closest runner up to HP for these services?[return]Nobody,  because we already worked with HP for the last years. It was a renewal  of the contract. The environment is running in Frankfurt in an HP data  center, so it was not even logical to ask another party. Last year, there  was a chance that we would move everything from the current data center  to a Dutch data center in Holland. That business case wasnt positive.  That is why it was decided to stay at Frankfurt; and as the old contract was almost ending, we started the renewal of it.[return][return]This was specifically for the apps of CCBS, your customer care and billing system.[return]Correct.[return][return]The understanding I got is that it was Huawei they were competing against.[return]Yes,  that is correct. HP in this case is responsible for the intra  part. It is running within HP. It is quite  a big data center, so HP is responsible for the intra parts[emdash]the  network and also the hardware[emdash]and also some parts of the software  environment. It is not an actual managed service provider. It is  not allowed to call them that because the service desk is simply in KPN. It is more like a service integrator. They are actually  managing our third parties, including Huawei. Huawei is responsible  for CCBS, which actually is 80 percent of the Telfort mobile domain.[return][return]Was there a point at which you considered moving what you are doing with HP over to Huawei?[return]No. Maybe Huawei wanted to take over some parts[emdash]for example, a process like problem management[emdash]but that was not an option for me. I wanted to stay with HP and make sure we have a new agreement for the coming years."
"To be honest, the contract was ending mid-2014, so we needed to reconsider what we would want to do with the HP contract. There were a number of opportunities with HP. We had a logical reevaluation moment for the contract with HP and the management of the Frankfurt systems, so that was the main reason. We were arguing what to do with the platform, because we had to choose to migrate the platform to a new type of platform or stay on the current platform while expanding the profit we get from the current platform. That was the main discussion."
"It was the amalgamation of four companies, which became the new Northbridge. We have computer centers throughout Canada. We really want to consolidate into one data center. There are services that we as an organization arent doing as well because they are dispersed among the four. We are really trying to have a solidified solution, and more robust and up-to-date services."
"Basically what we need is managed service for our data centers. We are an insurance company, and our core competency is not managing data centers and we dont. The company is a mid- to small-sized company with about 1,500 people. We dont have the skills of large companies to create a tier three data center. Our driving need is to partner up with a company that can actually provide us with those managed data center services that we can utilize."
"Actually, there was not a business need. Normally the business pushes that we need to do something in IT, but in this case it was just the opposite. We are convinced that we have improved in potential and cost reduction in our IT environment. Therefore, we started from the IT side to push this. That is why we started with the RFI and RFP."
"We bought a new company in Peru, Argentina, and Chile. We started a consolidation process for IT because we have six data centers among these three countries and we have to collapse it into one main data center and one second data center. The motivation is consolidating the infrastructure over Chile, Argentina, and Peru of the new company we bought some months ago."
"Since the beginning of time, GSKs environment in the world of AS400s[emdash]that particular operating system environment and hardware environment[emdash]has been entirely an insourced engagement. We used to run a piece of our ERP system off of the AS400s. Over the years, the AS400 environment has begun to lose its market share. In the last five years or so, the only support environment that we have had on the AS400 space has been only required for Lotus Notes. Our exposure to what we needed AS400 for has dramatically reduced. We were looking to move from an insourced support environment to an outsourced supplier; fully supplier-supported maintenance, care, and feeding of the AS400s."
"The renewal of data services management.[return][return]Who was the previous service provider for those services?[return]HP."
"At the time that we started, we were going through a large transformation of our global information services organization. As part of that transformation, we were changing some of the locations from which we were delivering our own internal services. My current team is split between Switzerland, the Philippines, Australia, and Argentina. We announced that as part of that change, we were closing our offices in Australia from a delivery of information services perspective. We were also reducing the size of our teams in Switzerland.[return]     There were some fairly large personnel changes, and we felt that while we were planning such a large transformation with our overall organization, it was the right time to question again how we sourced those services. We reviewed that in the past on different occasions and had chosen to keep those services as internal services, but we reviewed that decision again as part of this organizational change and decided to trigger this RFP to help support the final decision about whether we should source these services externally or continue to deliver them internally.[return][return]It sounds like you did decide to source.[return]We decided to source them externally and Wipro won that work, yes."
"Were doing what we call an infrastructure transformation. We are looking to consolidate our data centers, the way we manage our data centers, and the technology for Spectra Energy. Today they are scattered all over North America. We wanted to bring them from eight data centers to two data centers."
"We have eight data centers spread across the company, and it looked like an opportunity for us to consolidate and save some money."
"There were two major reasons. The first one was a question of money. They felt that social resources cost too much. They are trying to make a social plan. First of all, that is why they made this bid. Second of all, because they thought also that they didnt have a good level of services. From my point of view[emdash]I have stayed nine months inside Ipsen[emdash]I think they have good services with actual resources, but they dont have a good method. That is why it is a little tweaking, because I think they were wrong to think that they dont have a good level of service, but that is their decision.[return][return]Atos was their incumbent who was delivering it originally. Is that correct?[return]Yes."
"We needed a partner to outsource our data center to.[return][return]Why did they want to outsource their data center?[return]Because our infrastructure was quite old. We couldnt meet our business needs plus the new applications we are purchasing these days. We needed to reduce costs also. We had a huge team in charge of the data center, and it was quite expensive."
"We had multiple data centers across our enterprise. We are based in Canada and the US. We had basically eight different locations where we had data center type activity going on. We were trying to consolidate down into one primary and one disaster recovery site. Along with that, it put us in a situation where we wanted to be more centrally located between our Canadian facility and our US facilities and have just one location to have to deal with under the same rules and equipment and everything else; versus having multiple sites with multiple equipment and multiple charges, and all those types of things."
"For this specific deal which we invited HP to, the idea was to find a service supplier to consolidate the data center activity in Payroll. Payroll is a company that ADP bought in Chile, and the first idea was to try to consolidate that in our operation here in Brazil, but we had some limitation because there are a lot of restrictions to move data from customers in Chile out of Chile. We decided to re-engineer the IT process in Chile using one third party. To do that, we prepared a request for proposal."
"We were a start-up company making new products. Daimler is a huge old company in the car industry. It is a heavy industry with manufacturing globally. In the moovel and car2go business, we are dealing with car sharing. That is a new Internet-based company and product where we are not selling cars and we are not doing rental cars, but we are doing free-floating car-sharing, which is an online Internet service. We had different challenges not compatible with the huge car manufacturing industry. We were looking for new IT operations and a new partnership."
"<i>Answer given in writing and not in oral interview:</i>[return]Time to market, and flexibility in infrastructure possibilities to change all and define processes which fit our business.[return][return]Answered subsequently. [We are looking out for an ITIL enterprise operation. That may be a conflict because HP, IBM, and T-Systems are really good in operating standard software in a good known way, but we dont have a product which is 100 percent standard software. We have really individual software, and we have the business need to release business functionality really fast.]"
"The business need is threefold. One is around efficiencies for enterprise services like HR, finance, IT, infrastructure[emdash]so driving efficiencies, lower costs. Secondarily, it is around service quality. Lastly, it is around the integration of those functions[emdash]to become much more of an end-to-end process rather than a functional silo. Those three things drove us to issue the RFP for partners doing that."
"We issued a formal RFP on January 1 of this year. Three vendors responded to that, HP being one of the three. We were looking for a transformation in the way we were delivering mainframe services to the GE businesses. We were in a contract with IBM that is not typical of the standard outsourcing agreements that IBM writes with clients. We owned our data center. We owned our hardware. We still held ownership of a large majority of the software licenses. The primary thing that IBM provided to us was licensing for IBM products, and they provided us with personnel in the form of technical support teams to essentially run our operation for our mainframe customers."
"Since we are a 100 percent subsidiary to Daimler AG, we are still connected to the local data center that is provided by Daimler. Since we are a fast and flexible growing entity with specific business needs in terms of scalability, automization, globalization, etc., it turned out that our business needs cannot be sufficiently solved by the Daimler AG local data center. Therefore, we were looking for a suitable partner in the market. This led to a tender with HP participating."
"The Eurocontrol agency was organized per directorate. This means that every individual directorate had its own IT. I had a colleague who was managing the IT infrastructure, for instance, of another directorate. Since last year, we have been in the process of consolidating the IT into one organization. This means that we take over the IT infrastructure from all the other directorates while they take over from us the management of the office environment. In doing that, we needed to consolidate the processes also, and we took the opportunity of this project to go for another ITSM solution because the current solutions are too different. We needed one ITSM solution for the agency. We published the tender to select this new ITSM solution and the solution providers."
"The business need was that car2go started out in 2008 an internal project within Daimler. As such, they had to go to their data center. The data center over here is very good. It is ITYL-based, and they do all the good projects within the company, but they are not quite fit for dealing with a company like car2go. The main difference is that car2go is 24/7. It needs to be always on. This is a different condition. If you have your SAP system, it runs all day, but if you have a weekend, there is no problem to have an outage or downtime. The data center is more inward oriented with the internal project. car2go has the need to be 24/7, which means it really needs to run all the time within all the time zones. This is quite a different thing.[return]     They are also very agile, which means that businesspeople will come in and say, We need to do this. We need to do that. This is a change that the internal data center will not sustain because they are not built to do this. They are built to support processes. This is a completely different focus. This is how the IT landscape has changed so that most of the start-ups and modern companies, they will need to be very agile to be competitive."
"Basically, our contract was expiring. We had two outsourcing contracts with TIVIT: one for SAP systems and one for all other systems. It was a five- and six-year contract, and they both were about to expire. We decided to go to the market and check out other data center companies[emdash]what they were offering as far as technology, processes, people, and obviously our business case in terms of cost[emdash]and identify opportunities for cost savings and innovation for our environment. Basically, that was our motivation: end of contract. Also, after six years with the same company, we wanted to know if we had a good service provider.[return][return]Did you combine those two contracts into one or did you still keep them as two?[return]We combined them.[return][return]What was the workload that you needed, if you recall?[return]The RFP process was a one-year process. My colleague is responsible for data center services. He will be responsible for the technical specificity of designing the solution that we were looking for and also, with our data center team, analyzing these proposals. Technically speaking, our procurement team was responsible for the commercial evaluation and negotiation combined with our AES core procurement team as well. So, it was a very heavy year as far as analyzing and negotiating."
"To give you a context, we were planning to enter into the credit card business in India. We were evaluating a couple of vendors for providing us credit card services. HP was one of the contenders, but in the meantime what happened was we bought the Indian credit card portfolio of the Royal Bank of Scotland. HP was the vendor providing them the services. That is where we are in our selection for a vendor of credit card services."
"We are providing an Internet service. Everything we do is Internet-based. Even though we have vehicles that run on the street, the service itself is based on the Internet using a smart phone app and everything. This is fairly new to an automotive company that is building cars. Of course you have IT inside Daimler as well, but IT inside Daimler is usually tied to enterprise systems[emdash]the typical ERP systems[emdash]everything you need to run the company but not from a customer facing service point of view. In many other companies, the IT is not really set up to satisfy customer processes that typically come with an Internet business in the first place.[return]     So, we were confronted with a lot of challenges with our internal IT regarding processes, flexibility, and agility that could not with just a lot of task force mode operations be implemented inside our typical IT when it comes to Daimler. Even though we are independent of Daimler on an operational basis, we have in the past used Daimler resources in the IT environment to run our systems. At a certain stage we decided we need to do our own stuff there and really set up an environment for us that is cloud-based and allows us to satisfy our business requirements, which are different from what you typically find inside of Daimler.[return]"
"Its a second-generation outsourcing, and they wanted to see if there was any chance to exchange the current service provider."
"The chief architect brought forward a new vision for the enterprise that we wanted to move forward with. A key enabling component of that was going to be the capabilities that are normally expressed in a cloud: rapid on-demand as a service delivery of infrastructure callable by direct APIs and interfaces and so forth. His desire was to have a capability like that in place as rapidly as possible. He turned to me and said, Go make that happen. Get me a cloud."
"It is part of our strategy.[return][return]Is it a new developing strategy?[return]Yes. I joined TD about a year ago and I started a set of initiatives, and one of those was to build a cloud capability for on-premise as well as in public."
"We are a more-or-less known TK company, not because we are so big, but because we are a very recent company. This deal in Rio was the biggest German investment ever made outside of Germany in the entire history of their country. It was a total investment of 6 billion euros and so much confusion afterwards. To be very accurate, this month is the end of our fiscal year and we have, for the first time after four years of operation, broken even. We are very excited about it, but up to this point we have wasted a lot of money; not only the 6 billion at the start with the Capex investment, but also the operational expenditure was very high in the first year. Because of this, it was very problematic. A lot of people were talking about it. ThyssenKrupp group was affected by the share prices and so on. CSA is very well known within the group because of those reasons; not only our sales, but also our cousin company in Alabama, US, but that was already sold. We went through a merge and acquisition period for 18 months at the beginning of this year, but TK in the end only sold half of it. It sold the Alabama side[emdash]which is downstream of our initial processes[emdash]to one of our competitors, but not CSA. For CSA, the offers were very low and the top management trusts the teams decision here. If they could wait for one or two years more, but not even this. It was a half a year more. We would finally start seeing good results and much better performance regarding the position of operations and financial figures. They have geared up to sell us by now. Nobody knows the official story of course, but thats us. We are always in the spotlight."
"What drove the need for this purchase?[return]Many things knitted together. First of all, we had entered into a long relationship with our current provider. We were not that happy with the motivation they were expressing to us; the ability to make some basic improvement and so on was not that high. Actually, at that time, they were asking us to pay for the analysis and so on. Second, it was a response to a big program we went to which was called Spirits, where actually we should be able to reduce the allowed cost of the IT department by 20 percent in three years. I would ask [our provider], What can you do about it, and how can you help us? and naturally, the answer was, We cannot help you. So we were the trigger and the model as well.[return]     We were using this company as service based; and actually, from time to time, what happened was that instead of having big, experienced people managing the infrastructure, we ended up with a lot of juniors. We were mainly busy with doing knowledge transfer and repeating 10 to 15 times the same story every year. We finished by ending this situation and launching this RFP."
"We have a contract for outsourcing with IBM which has been running for almost 10 years and finishes next December 31[emdash]the end of this year[emdash]and it needs to be replaced, of course. Thats what prompted the process.[return][return]There were four specific areas where you were asking for bids and HP bid on three of them, correct?[return]Exactly. Yes.[return][return]<i>Additional comment in writing: </i>Full outsourcing of all infrastructure management and operation."
"In July 2013, we were hosted at IBM in the standard computers[emdash]that is, the normal structure[emdash]and we had been operating for five years. Thats where our data center was since 2009. For five years we operated under the standard structure at IBM. At this point, we had three issues on which we had to make a decision: we needed to renew the hardware[emdash]in other words, do a technological update of the hardware; we needed to do the technical update of the software; and we also needed to move toward a solution that was more flexible and on the same level as the equipment[emdash]in other words, where I would be able to reduce and increase as needed.[return]     At this point, we launched into the market an RFP, which is a request for a quote to be made. In this quote, we had as participants IBM; HP; Activity, which is a Brazilian company; UOL Diveo, which is also a Brazilian company; and some others. In this request, the first point was a reduction in the costs of the data center structure; the second point was to have an infrastructure that was malleable[emdash]in other words, that allowed reduction or increase according to need, paying according to use; the third point was that we have the same performance or a better performance than we had in the old environment. That is where we were able to visualize that our solution lay in the cloud.[return][return]Besides IBM and HP, which were the other companies that you sent a request to?[return]Tapa, Google[emdash]that is the famous American Google[emdash]Activity, and UOL Diveo.[return]     Another thing is that in this time, we had two centers: one in IBM and another of our own, inside our company. Our system is very integrated[emdash]for example, sales, SAP, account systems, account payable, and other things. At this time, we had two data centers in two different locations; and this was a problem, because interface between the systems is very complicated. This is one very fine point. Two, we wanted to define one provider only[emdash]one data center only. I integrated everything in the same data center today. This is a very nice advantage. You have one infrastructure for all the systems in the same data center. It simplifies everything you have integrated."
"We had a big company with almost 55 companies all over the world with a lot of different ERP all over the world, and different processes. We have a lack of standardization and organizational processes in systems and in order to reduce the risk. We have old technologies around the world, so I know that we need to reduce the risk of technology, improve efficiency of processes, and standardize IT system and IT governments and business governments.[return]     In both processes, we decided to start a new transformation program with all of those companies. To do this, we chose to start this big ERP implementation based on SAP technology for standard ERP, and a lot of other systems like supplier relations, contact center, and other services[emdash]I dont know[emdash]a lot of things that we see. That is the reason. The program is a big program: five or six years long at this stage."
"The need for cost reduction, consolidation, and more flexible contracts.[return][return]When you say consolidation, do you mean that you had a number of different providers working with you?[return]We did have an idea to try to consolidate, but I also talked to more a technical consolidation[emdash]some consolidation of data centers and services, reduced footprint, those sorts of things[emdash]and the move to the cloud."
"It was purely because we were playing on what the current cost is of running operations. Because of the way this deal progressed, it came out very clearly that the customer is actually looking for a cost reduction. At the same time, they would not like to risk their operations. So cost reduction is one aspect. While we were signing the contract or agreement with HP, it was made very clear that whatever price point we agreed on with the customer, HP should be able to meet that to a reasonable extent. Because we are front-ending the bid, if we agreed to a price and HP could not give us a comfortable feeling that they could meet the price point which is attributed for their part, then we would reopen the bid to look for other partners. However, HP was reasonably close to the target which we had expected in terms of the price points."
"These are new services your organization is going to offer, correct?[return]Exactly. Even from an HP side also, I understand there have been new initiatives that theyre planning, mainly for the support services and enterprise cloud related activities on the SMB segment."
"ING, I think this was a bit of a new thing. We didnt want to prescribe too much on the solution. Therefore, we asked for a vendor solution in relation to building a cloud. There were not too much prerequisites from ING. Normally, we prescribe all what the functionality and everything. We had framework and all the other things were open for the parties to answer.[return][return]What was prompting this in the first place? What were the strategies? Is this a strategic development process?[return]Yes. Absolutely so. This is strategic to us. We are still, at the moment, we have all the platforms in-house, I would say. We have a legacy environment and need to come up, and we want to move to a flexible and efficient platform."
"We have a new IT strategy. Ive been in my role for a year now and Ive been brought in to basically, on a global basis, modernize our infrastructure, prepare us for more agility, deal with some of our risks and some of our challenges, significantly reduce the landscape, and actually start to provide world-class infrastructure, on a global scale underpinning ING Bank. We have a next major strategic imperative to, basically, TIF infrastructure services. We play around on the IT and rethink how our whole operating platform, the on-the-line technical architecture, functions in the role that we play underpinning the bank site; all the way from the data center locations to the platform architecture. One of the areas I look after is the workplace environment, which is running under a separate initiative."
"We could talk about that for hours or just talk about the main points. Lets do the second, the main points. We have outsourced our complete IT infrastructure. What we did keep in-house is the development and maintenance of our core applications[emdash]specialized applications, such as SAP and others. We have now outsourced our data center operation, with all our servers and the WAN connection and the client computing, such as Notebook. I just want to leave it with these main points.[return][return]Was the purpose to gain increased efficiency?[return]We had concluded a contract previously with a competitor of yours, CSC, and now the contract has ended. We have decided not to renew the contract. We want to put it out for entirely new bidding, actually, at the end of the contract."
"The first is an internal evolution. Eurocontrol is a company with several directorates. In terms of IT, there is a fission of the main two directorates; before now, each directorate owned its own ITSM solution. The intention of this new contract is to centralize the ITSM solution for each directorate. That was one of the first concerns. [return]     The second thing is about the multisourcing context. We have outsource contracts for our server environment, our network environment, and our office automation environment; and we need a centralized ITSM solution to support each service desk of this multisourcing environment."
"First of all, it is important to understand that the client, when they started to prepare an RFP, was not so clear about what they really wanted. The tender was prepared that way. It was pretty much open to different kinds of solutions, ranging from the Cloud solution to the delivery of respective hardware directly to their data center. It was very obvious from all the proposals[emdash]not only from HP but also from the other vendors[emdash]that each of the vendors approached it a little bit differently. For example, HP shared the ability to provide the solution based on Cloud services, where, for example, PONTECH, the small company, focused just on the delivery of a not-so-well integrated solution and on a really low price. This company, CGS, is a manufacturing company producing tires, and they are a very price-centered business, so their approach is little bit different than HPs. HP had a much more complex proposal, and from the technical point of view, I would say a much better proposal; but in terms of money there was really a huge difference between these two proposals[emdash]the winning one and the HP one.[return][return]Is this an upgrade for them?[return]Its more about the SAP. It wasnt about SAP infrastructure. Basically, CGS is a holding company. They have three tire companies: Rubena, Mitas, and Savatech. They are spread all around the Czech Republic. One branch is also in Slovenia, and theyve also got a branch in the United States. Dont ask me where, because I dont know it; Ive never been to it. All these three companies are using SAP, but they use a completely different infrastructure for each of the branches. One is built on PLUM System, one is on Bento Solutions, the third one is some Unix[emdash]I think IBM Unix, but Im not sure. Theyve decided to make one infrastructure for all these three companies. I said that they had not decided in the beginning what they really wanted; the reason is that there were pushes from the different companies to go for the platform that theyve got experience with. So when we started to put together the RFP, I was pushing them to decide for one platform and one solution. They were not willing to make this kind of decision, so the RFP was pretty much open in scope."
"Currently within ING, we have a dispersed landscape. From an infrastructure perspective, we have all technologies known to mankind. There are 80 data centers. In those 80 data centers, there is a huge variety in technology, technology vendors, and technology partners that results in a lot of effort from a resourcing perspective to life-cycle management, to upgrading, to doing the automation, to doing the security. As a target, we said, We need a standardized environment from an infrastructure perspective, computer network and storage, and the management tools around it so we can be more effective and deliver identical services throughout the organization for all business units."
"It was the implementation of the corporate intranet for our company worldwide, and we were going to start from scratch. The application is still nonexistent, so its a project for a new application."
"Our strategy is to bring more of our data away from the different applications into the cloud and the Internet in general. So more and more, we will have our data not with the users anymore, and they have to load the data from quite far away. Specifically for that, these WAN optimizers are required to give a better performance of those capabilities. Thats one thing, to increase the performance of our accessing remote data.[return]      The other thing is the prioritization of particular traffic. We are going in the direction of more video and voice services for our users also served by Internet-based services and this kind of big-time traffic needs the proper prioritization compared to other data traffic. Thats the second reason why we need optimizers to do that."
"For us it was a couple of things. If you look at the legacy IT workspace, were in the financial vertical; and being a bank, we do things in a very old, traditional way. We develop systems very ITIL based, Six Sigma, PMLC, SBLC[emdash]all the disciplines you can wrap around doing a program. Its what we do today. What that actually translated into was a problem for us that said in the new world where banking is now being challenged by nontraditional providers[emdash]so think of this: we can go down a path of anything from a Starbucks to a Google or anybody; but PayPal is always one I like to use. So PayPal actually, for all intents and purposes, starts to act like a bank. They take payments, they process payments, they do all this kind of fun stuff. Thats not necessarily something that we would always play in. However, when you start to take notice of them and they become multi-billion-dollar companies, they in turn start to become something that is, Okay, youre not entirely in my space, but youre starting to choose something thats recognizable that were probably going to want to compete in.[return]     So this is something where the bank had stood back. Our chief architects vision was to say, How do we get more nimble? How do we become the differentiator in the industry? Our differentiator in the past has been the customer service[emdash]legendary customer service is what we call it. It has served us very well; but again, we do recognize that in the financial vertical, thats not a hard thing to clone and our competition is cloning it and catching up to us. What were looking at now is what that next thing is thats going to separate us from everybody else, and one of them is speed to market: speed to market on new technology, speed to market on applications such that we can get out there quickly, get in front of our customers, maybe not always having the perfect product every time, but getting more product out there and offering a wider set of services.[return]     Inside of all that, add one other piece, which is common services. Today[emdash]and most banks work like this[emdash]if you go and get a loan, the balance system for the loan is written in that application. The balance system for your credit card is in that system. The balance for your savings account is in that system. We dont have any of what we call microapps or microservices. By leveraging and making all those things containers, we can turn around and make our speed to market much faster. So this all translates into a coined term that we have[emdash]and its out there in the industry in different words[emdash]what we call IT trio. We call IT trio that old methodology: put in the money, do all the disciplines, do all the fun stuff within 18 months from the time we pick up something to the time we can put it out as an offering to our customers. We want to turn that around and do it in weeks.[return]      In order to do all of that, we required[emdash]and this brings it back full circle now to why were having this conversation[emdash]why we went to the vendors in the industry, and we said, We need infrastructure as a service. We need you to do it in an open and standard way, and we also need you to do it in a way that is a, what we would call, by-the-drink model. In other words, I just want to be able to go out and say, I need four business modules and I need these kinds of services packed on top of them, and then I need to add these applications in. Create for me the container of all that work; and then, boom! I can sit down and start doing it. So now I can take these young kids that come out of universities, all these coders, and let them go and code. They dont need to understand how many virtual CPUs they need and how much storage they need[emdash]all this kind of fun stuff. We want to be able to give them the containers they need to be able to do their job immediately. Let them do what they do best.[return]      That is what our RFP went out to do. We went out to HP, we went out to Cisco. Originally we had also used IBM, but they got knocked out because their X86 Server business was sold to Lenovo. Then we also looked at Dell; but we didnt see them as an enterprise player, so we didnt go down that space. I knocked it down to HP and Cisco, those two providers, at that point in time."
"The overall ambition here is to dramatically standardize our infrastructure and, at the same time, fully automate our provisioning processes, as well for the infrastructure as the applications; and that, combined, is called a zero-touch fully automated private cloud[emdash]not a public cloud, but a private cloud, on-premise, in our own data centers. That basically meant that we needed a couple of capabilities: a fully standardized infrastructure architecture; and at the same time, a software suite that was able to automate the most relevant processes in the infrastructure, as well as in application deployments. We call it the continuous delivery pipeline."
"In a nutshell, the main idea is that Beaulieu International is growing or emerging from a western European-oriented company toward a worldwide company; and our current ICT infrastructure and organization was designed for support and services for western Europe. If you go worldwide, you have time differences; you have language problems; and also you should have a scalable infrastructure which you can expand into the different corners of the world. That was what we were originally looking for during the business project."
"I guess our primary objective was total cost of ownership reduction. There were multiple initiatives and projects that required WAN optimization to really mitigate the incremental costs associated with those projects. In some cases, but to a less extent, its around managing quality of service; and I guess the third objective, really, was around our ability to do reporting and troubleshooting.[return][return]And Im sorry, so your ability to self serve on that? Tell me what you mean by that third objective.[return]Some of it, yes. HP already offered substantial end-to-end services, so using this service would enable us to pursue HP to deliver the sort of reporting and analytical services. But self serve in the sense that we would directly use the infrastructure to do it ourselves. We would obviously have done that through our partner."
"A couple of things. One was flexibility and the ability to right-size the loads they are currently handling. Their structure changes in terms of M&A; they just divested quite a significant part of their business, which was a plastic packaging business. They may well acquire other businesses to grow in Asia. When youre a company thats divesting and acquiring, you need the ability to step up and step down your IT quite quickly. A key driver was flexibility, the ability to step up and step down as they acquire or divest businesses; and I would say a second key one was cost. In their current data center, their current ITS, they were nearing end of life for most of their platforms; they were facing a big capital refresh, and they didnt want to do that. So it was both avoiding a significant capital refresh of their existing IT estate and seeking lower operational costs."
"The current data center, which was being managed and hosted by Proxar, was reaching eight years old. It was a very traditional-type data center arrangement whereby we, REXAM, still owned the hardware, but we procured the hosting and managed service from HP. It required quite a large capital investment to replace the hardware. REXAM also, over the last five years, has been seeking to reposition itself as a primary global cans manufacturer. Therefore, weve been divesting some of our other businesses[emdash]our glass and our plastics businesses[emdash]which meant that the underlying infrastructure was way oversized for what we needed. So, in a nutshell, it was a good opportunity for us to look at the global infrastructure for data center and say, Is it still the right fit for REXAM? and What options do we have? Different technologies have moved quite a bit in eight years."
"Abbott, which was a Fortune 100 company, made a decision in October of 2012 to separate the company into two entities, both Fortune 200s. The new company that was spun off obviously did not have any network and voice infrastructures organizations, and the RFP was as a result of that business decision to separate the companies."
"Its a combination of things. Our DIT in our agencies is delivered through different business units, and there is a strategic objective to go to a single IT within the agency. Each of the business units today has its own ITSM solution deployed, so we need to have one single ITSM solution to support the IT of the agency, if only to reduce the costs. Its mainly reorganization, cost reduction, and support contracts on some of the existing ITSM solutions that are coming to expiration."
"Two years ago, I set up this outsourcing agreement with HP for Sulzer Pumps. We have two SAP platforms within Sulzer Pumps. I took one of the platforms at the time and outsourced that to HP. However, we still retained the water SAP system within the business, so we were running that ourselves. From that point of view, it was quite natural for us to take the second step and set up the SAP from the water business on the same platform as the rest: at HP."
"We knew that we had a big deployment to do. Were moving out of one of our existing data centers, and were also installing a large amount of new equipment. The amount of stuff that were installing is about 50 percent of what weve already got in a managed hosted data center. We were looking at how we were going to do that, and how we were going to do that for a reasonable price; because according to the original contract with our existing vendor, if wed gone ahead and basically stuck in more stuff to that point, the cost would have been too much for the business to bear. So we were looking at alternatives. We started an RFI process[emdash]or a tender, in fact[emdash]to find a new data center vendor; and that went to the current managed hosting vendor, and it went to a number of organizations, including HP."
"Basically, the infrastructure is currently located in an old data center. The applications and services are running on very old hardware and old versions of Windows and SQL databases as well. We have Windows 2003 ending support now. Thats probably the compelling event that caused us to decide to move our services to a different environment.[return][return]Are those the main applications?[return]Yes, there is a variety of applications. They are all bespoke applications that have been developed over the years specifically for this companys operations, where the logistics business and these applications relate to tracking, delivering, and invoicing of parcels."
"Basically, since we launched the shared services in 2013, we were looking to replace the existing vendors with someone that was more international and available in Hong Kong, US, and so forth, being able to fulfill our needs in terms of capacity, evolution, and so forth. Thats why we launched this RFP."
"The back story is that we run on an SAP system. Weve hosted our own hardware since we first put the system in, in 2001. The current hardware is quite old, and its due to be replaced, so we had two options: do we replace it with our own hardware on-site; or do we look to a third party to provide it as a service? Nowadays, technologys moved on; theres a lot more of that sort of thing around. Last time we looked at replacing the hardware, the services available werent that good. We felt the time had come to look at the option of looking at some sort of hosting environment, as it was worthwhile. Thats why we started looking at hosting.[return]     We involved HP because we wanted to deal with a credible partner. Although we host the hardware ourselves, the software itself is currently supported by a company called Atos. So we approached Atos, and we also approached HP to get a competitive quote. There were a couple of other companies involved as well. There was a company called Logicalis, who are a UK company. We also approached a company called CSI, which stands for Computer Systems Integration, who weve done a little bit of work with. They were recently acquired by a company that provided hosting environments.[return][return]And you also looked at Dell?[return]Dell is our preferred hardware supplier, and we currently run on Dell hardware, so thats why we were interested in talking to them."
"Internal reorganization. Sulzer has made a strategy of not building up SAP Basis expertise internally. We outsource that to those companies that specialize in supporting SAP systems[emdash]not just the hardware, but network connectivity and SAP Basis support."
"In fact, its not really the business needs because its not driven by a business request. Its more driven by the need of consolidation of the global management of the infrastructure, meaning that we were managed by several companies previously and we have a need to have a consolidated company all over the world, meaning in all the different regions: Asia-PAC, Americas, and EMEA."
"Wed made an applications centralization strategy, so for our applications centralization control, weve obviously got to have somewhere to host it. We dont have a centralized hosting instance, and therefore I wanted to run with some other service, because I dont want to touch any tin. I dont want any tin in the business at all, if I can manage it. We dont need it. Id rather have active managed services[emdash]my IaaS, my PaaS, and my SaaS are all right. If I can get there, thats what I want."
"Weve been in essentially the same IT outsource contract for around a decade. There was an initially termed contract of, I think, five years with HP; and it continued to be extended until it reached almost the decade mark. It needed to go out to market again; but also we needed it to go out to market again because we werent really getting the outcomes that we wanted from the old outsource contract. The old contract and the old arrangement had both parties not really delivering the intent of that contract; things had become a bit lazy, and things had become quite overpriced as well. Certain outlying items[emdash]such as storage costs, for example[emdash]werent representative of the market, and we were paying millions of dollars in excess of what we should have been paying."
"Was it just the renewal that prompted the bid process?[return]It was a renewal. It was giving us a model of capex versus opex, which we ended up rolling back to, Lets just go for like for like in terms of the renewal; and thats when we put the RFP together[emdash]or, I should say, I put the RFP together.[return][return]So you didnt use a third-party adviser? You put the RFP together?[return]Yes. I didnt get involved in the exigencies and that kind of stuff, but I was pretty much the meat and bones of the actual RFP in terms of services, service levels, etc."
"Its totally new services. We are moving. We are initiating the business in Brazil. We are creating a new branch for the Commerzbank here in South America."
"We are on the brink of letting go of our own data center and implementing a green-field SAP solution within an outsourced data center.[return][return]What was the compelling event that made this necessary right now?[return]The fact that we are a company engaged in midsize takeovers, all on their own platform, with their own ERP systems. We wanted to consolidate everything to a new platform."
"Beginning this year, we acquired enterprise agreements with Oracle; and inside this enterprise agreement, the ULA, we acquired the Oracle Source Suite here: Oracle Business Intelligence, Oracle WebLogic[emdash]we acquired many products from Oracle, and it started many projects. One of these projects is this SOA project, which I am leading."
"I bid almost everything[emdash]everything significant, I bid. When our significant contracts come due, I bid them, unless its[emdash]for instance, I dont rebid my SAP business every six years or whatever, just because its so engrained that it doesnt make a lot of sense."
"One of the primary needs is back-to-core business, and another is quality; I think those are the two primary reasons to do this: quality and back-to-core business. We dont want to do these basic services ourselves; and the current services that we have are not delivering the quality that the business needs. It should deliver a quality increase, and it should deliver a focus on things that we do care about; and that is not commodity[emdash]we dont want to do commodity anymore. We do realize that it is a cost increase because its more expensive to do it, as we calculated; but we dont want to do the commodity ourselves anymore."
"We are not happy with the results from the service in the last years from HP. The satisfaction with HP is not good. We hope for good satisfaction with SAP.[return][return]Is that why you bid these services out?[return]One thing is the price; but the biggest point is the bad communication from and the bad knowledge of the consultants for HP[emdash]a lot of the consultants, not all.[return][return]Can you give some examples of that poor experience?[return]In the past, the consulting company was EDS; and HP bought EDS and fired a lot of people. So we have lost more and more consultants with experience and the remaining consultants that we have in the team are not able to give us a good proposal for some requests. It means[emdash]this is my opinion[emdash]that the consultants use the same solution all the time: We must make a program. We must make some user access. They dont know the new functions in SAP.[return][return]Are there other reasons you decided not to renew with HP?[return]This decision was made as a team, together with the CIO, with my boss, and with colleagues from the purchase department and from IT. We looked at the offers from HP, SAP, and other companies; and we decided that the offer from SAP is, from the viewpoint of the technical solution and the final solution, the best way for the future."
"The current contract with HP, who was the incumbent, was coming due in July, I think it was, of last year. There was a need to go out to market to test the market position of those particular services: pricing, innovation, and all kinds of criteria that we take a look at. Amgen then goes ahead and issues a request for proposal for the services, and we competitively bid them. At the end of the day, we came out with HP as the supplier of choice moving forward for the next three years."
"Findomestic already was an HP client for the same services, but using a different IT architecture. The evolution of the HP service for this new product, on one hand, made us want to upgrade to a better quality product. On the other hand, we had noticed that HP had started to delay the releases of updates for the old architecture; and that was detrimental to us, since it raised costs for all the branches of our firm that had to deploy and install the new packages. That was one of the reasons.[return]     The second point is that Findomestic is trying to validate itself through a tighter model of risk classification and management. That means that all the reports we have to send from now on to the Italian Central Bank[emdash]that is the recipient of the output of this product[emdash]will be unique and more detailed. The previous product could not support either that load of data or the architecture of the new calculation requested by the Bank of Italy. So Findomestic had to make this evaluation, which of course meant to put in competition different suppliers. HP eventually won the bid and got the order."
"We come from a world where we had an internal service provider called Lufthansa Systems, and we recognized that they[emdash]to make the story short[emdash]were no longer able to perform in the right manner in the fast, innovative market of IT infrastructure services. We at Lufthansa had not the intent, and it was not our core business, to invest in that kind of IT infrastructure business anymore. So it was at least a kind of mixture between a portfolio decision and a decision regarding getting right quality of services for the right amount of money."
"The contracts we had up to that point were about to expire, both with Oracle and with IBM, and we decided to unify the services."
"Weve acquired a lot of businesses in the last 10 years and they all have their own ERP system. We wanted to combine those ERP systems in one, and we selected SAP for that. We needed somebody who can host SAP for us."
"Previously answered. [HP is our current provider...of all of our managed services. Our contract was coming up for expiration, and we put out everything for proposal and bid.][return][return]Answered subsequently. [We had gone through a couple of different contracts with HP over the course of 10 years; we were an EDS customer that got acquired by HP, and weve been with HP since they acquired EDS...Because of the complexities of our services and the number of services that we currently get from HP, there was not a one-size-fits-all company out there; we dont actually fit into HPs model either.]"
"We always have major incident management as a service. We were just renewing the contract.[return][return]HP was the incumbent; correct?[return]Correct."
"The contract with T-Systems came to an end, and both parties decided not to renew that contract."
"Basically, with our current supplier, which is Vodafone, we have about 400 servers in total in their data center. The service we get is not bad, but its a bit limited around proper cloud services; we do not deal with public cloud services. Also, its not much consumption-based billing; its more about we pay for the environment, and then we build service on top. Its a very old, traditional method of data hosting. Weve wanted to exploit more modern technology[emdash]especially with public cloud services, which were specifically Amazon and Azure Microsoft."
"EIS officer: Ill take this one. We had implemented an NEC solution back in the early 1980s. The technology architecture was such that it grew organically; so instead of one PBX platform, we have over 11 just supporting the Burbank and site vicinities, which is basically southern California. We needed not only to provide additional functionality to our clientele, but to collapse the infrastructure to try to offset some expenses as it relates to our operational budget. Thats what really prompted the evaluation[emdash]that, and that its at the end of its life cycle as well."
"IT Business Partner: The HR process is learning and training. What we were looking for was an alternative for a learning solution we have currently had running for some years now[emdash]a solution which is more innovative and able to be operated with less effort, for example[emdash]to get the idea whether SaaS makes sense for us to have a better solution than we have currently. We were not in an emergency case, that we had to get rid of it the next day; but there is still a need, or the idea to have another solution, or to have a real alternative. Therefore, we looked whats available on the market; and the Saba solution has a good placement. We found them in the Gartner portfolio as, I think, market leader. The part of the learning process we focused on, I can say, is the WBT campaign management. In general, we can imagine saying, If the solution works well, then well see whether we can increase the amount of the solution portfolio we use; but for this POC, it was focused for campaign management. In effect, its something where we, for Siemens company[emdash]Imagine you have 300,000 employee. These 300,000 employees have to attend certain compliance trainings and certain security trainings to make sure that everybody has the same understanding of not only the idea, but of the needs within our business to handle security issues and to comply with compliance needs of the company. Search for themselves[emdash]thats the process behind that.[return]IT Manager: Maybe also, to give insight, the current solution is possible to enhance some new requirements. The lifetime is already expired for the product; but we know that on the market side, there are a lot of possibilities. For example, uses of Akamai integration of other learning content providers, more external users, mobile experts[emdash]these kinds of functionalities are not available in our existing solution; and it would be a lot of effort to implement that if HR wants this kind of functionality. So there are demands in near future which would be easier to have a third solution which would support this kind of feature; but the current solution has some lacks of innovation on further product roadmaps to achieve. So this is also not only about topics scalability; its also about flexibility or integration to new demands or to new features. So we have no crisis, as mentioned before, that we have to leave the software for. Its something where we look into the market: whether Software as a Service can support the current solution and, of course, give us some value proposition or innovation topics which are not covered at the moment.[return]IT Business Partner: We were highly motivated to find another solution. It was not what you possibly sometimes have with customers who say, Lets have a market check to see where we are at the moment and how we want to proceed with the things we already have. We were really motivated to find another solution, and I think weve come to the reasons why it wasnt HP and Saba at the end. Its less the performance of the tool and the team who presented it to us than the conditions we found in the company, especially  the last month, which have changed a lot now."
"We have a major project that were calling Unity. Our company, through the course of its growth, has grown primarily through acquisition throughout the years. As such, weve inherited several ERP systems along the way, and its come to the point where we want to merge all those together into one system of SAP HANA. Thats what were calling Project Unity."
"The idea was to buy first a platform-as-a-service for our new SAP system. Cloud can be many things, but it was not a public cloud or anything like that. It was platform-as-a-service for our SAP. The needs that we had was to build and operate this new system. Its a greenfield for us.[return]     There were a few reasons we went with a third party. First of all, its a one-time project. We dont believe that we will build another SAP for Teva[emdash]we hope that we dont need to build one in the near future[emdash]so its a one-time project. The second thing is that we needed a high visibility system that was very stable, and we do believe there are companies that can do the work better than ourselves. The third thing is that we at Teva are focused now on many major global programs that will change the way IT is working and also the services that we are providing, and we didnt want to spend or to be focused on this type of activity. We dont see it as our business to build this type of service."
"Previously answered. [GTA, my agency, runs backoffice for most of the other state agencies in Georgia, so its all consolidated. We had outsourced it in 2009; data center services, wide-area network, voice, local-area network[emdash]all of that stuff is outsourced. The incumbents are IBM Global Services, which does all the data center, print, and end-user compute; and AT&T, which does the WAN, LAN, and voice stuff. What was being bid was that we were peeling off part of the IBM scope, which was service desk and all of the cross-functional areas[emdash]all the idle functions such as incident management, problem management, the PMO, the security program, the project office, all of that stuff[emdash]as well as all of the tools, both for running the data center, around event management, and for billing as well. So that was the scope. It was roughly[emdash]the incumbent, IBM, is doing that workload today with about 211 FTEs.][return][return]What was driving that shift in the first place?[return]It was the anticipation that, while weve still got a couple of years to go on the rest of the IBM agreement, were in the process of rebidding the AT&T agreement; and we had decided that, now that were going into the second generation of our sourcing deal, instead of doing one big all-in procurement to just get one vendor to do all telecom services and one vendor to do all data center services, we were going to move to a strategy of actually bidding it by service tower. We were anticipating that we could end up with as many as nine different vendors to manage here, when we get done later this year with the telecom rebid. Then the same thing could happen in 2017 on the IBM side. So part of this was really just preparing for that and getting an independent third party to sit on top of all those service towers and manage it for us."
"At the end, all of the proposals that we[emdash]in the final round, HP, Embratel, and then IBM were selected for the three final companies. Then we started working with those three companies; and technically speaking, all of them met our requests in the process. At the end of the final round that made up the process, it was commercial issues in that process. For all three competitors, we gave them a target; and with the final target, one of them, Embratel, won this process.[return][return]So in the end, it came down to the price?[return]Yes. Also its easy to understand why Embratel[emdash]its an America Movil company. You know the company, right?[return][return]Embratel? Im not as familiar with them.[return]America Movil company [in Mexico]. Probably you know that better.[return][return]What prompted you to outsource these services, to start the whole process in the first place?[return]Not the whole process. We are trying to sustain the stability of SAP; manage inside the warehouse[emdash]our old data warehouse; manage the primary call center for the users here[emdash]what else? We have some activity here. I dont remember exactly, but its part of the new development, the new project, something Ive met; its not in the outsourcing process."
"IThe questionnaire I have filled in does not make very much sense related to the situation we have been in with this purchase.[return][return]Tell me about that. Give me the background on it and so on.[return]The background is that we have, for 12 years now, had an outsourcing contract with IBM covering very many of the services on both set mainframe and the NonStop platform. Now we were in a situation where the contract with IBM was coming to an end, and we have, for a while now in Nordea, been investigating what we wanted to do. One thing for sure was we wanted to take better control. We wanted to be more agile than we felt we had been with the contract we had with IBM. Then, of course, we also wanted a good price for whatever solution we chose, but that was not the main driver. The main driver was the control; secondly the agility; and then the cost, of course, should be okay.[return]     In that situation, we decided that we wanted to take home a core part of what had been outsourced until now. So alternatively we wanted to take it all home. So either we would take home the bigger part[emdash]especially the parts that we believed important for being in control[emdash]and that meant all design authority. It meant all of what is often called middleware or OTP sub-systems. It meant the capacity planning overall. It meant the security parts. What we wanted to leave out was the very base commodity services of hardware, operative system, storage management, and monitoring. So that was one way to go.[return]     The other was to do a fully insourcing of everything, including the hardware and the OS and so on. We ran these tracks in parallel. We ran the full insourcing together with this part outsourcing. The contract was terminating, so we saw it all as an insourcing where we would then investigate and make a new contract with one or two suppliers for the part that we still might want to outsource. That was the scenario.[return]     When there is questions about why we did not choose the insourcing option, yes, but we had actually chosen to insource everything that was important for us to insource. Then it was just a matter of, Do we want to take the full thing, or would we still have the things outsourced that are not so important for us to do ourselves? There we ended up deciding that those areas we had put in scope were not so important for us that we wanted to do the full insourcing. We wanted to have those outsourced. In that situation, we started out with very many potentials on our long list, and on the short list we actually only had IBM, HP and the insourcing option. There we chose to make the contract with IBM for the set platform and make the contract with HP for the NonStop platform.[return][return]So you did end up splitting it between the two.[return]Yes. First of all, we took home two-thirds of the scope for both platforms from IBM, and then we made a contract for the commodity services where we split it between IBM for the set platform and HP for the NonStop platform.[return][return]What part did you keep doing in-house?[return]We brought in-house all the things that would either require or generate any kind of Nordea-specific knowledge, or at least any important kind of Nordea-specific knowledge. Everything about the design of the infrastructure[emdash]the design authority[emdash]that we will be the ones doing the active design. Im not saying that we will not listen to the suppliers, but we will do the design; we will have the design authority in-house. We will be in charge of all infrastructure apart from hardware, operating system, and storage. We will do all the batch planning and scheduling. We will have the suppliers monitor our batch and online and respond, of course, according to instructions and escalate to a second level, which in many cases may be a second level in Nordea. It also means that since our business IT people seldom order anything changed in the operating system, they will not be in direct contact with the supplier. The suppliers will be seen as a subcontractor to Nordeas infrastructure and operations department."
"The initial requirements and desire started off as a risk mitigation exercise around the controls and processes we have in our data centers and the environment across the region. So looking at that, we had a couple things. One was risk; the other was to protect the organization from future growth. Weve had significant growth over the last five years, and we project significant growth over the next five years. So our existing infrastructure needed a bit of a revamp. Otherwise, we believed we would be in a difficult position to support the business in an agile base moving forward. Then lastly, always cost. That goes without saying."
"First off, let me make it clear as to who I am and what my role is. The contract that we spoke to HP about was for a company called PZ Cussons, PZ Cussons is a large consumer packaged goods company thats global. Its is based here in the UK and has a large presence in Africa and in Asia. It has some presence in North America as well. Its very global. Its listed on the Financial Times Stock Exchange in London, so its a private organization and theres probably about 5,000 employees, I think, globally; maybe 6,000 employees globally[emdash]something like that. Now, I actually dont work for PZ Cussons.[return][return]Youre a third-party advisory firm.[return]Thats right. So what we were actually contracting for was an IMS piece of work. What I mean by that was that PZ Cussons is implementing a new SAP ERP solution, and the decision was taken that they didnt want to host that internally. They wanted that to be hosted externally in the cloud by an experienced software provider."
"Infrastructure Manager:[return]All our contracts were going to end in December 2014 so we decided, almost one year earlier, to make a bid. After ten years with the same provider we decided it was time to check the market again to see what opportunities could be available, both for possible new providers and for possible new economical and technological opportunities."
"We already had a facility management contract so we didnt have a specific problem. Weve had a continuous contract for several years so the decision was about continuing the facility management contract."
"It was services actually. We had an outsourcing contract that was running out, and we were looking for a different scope. In the process, we chose to shoot out a bid for different offers to see what the different providers could cope with. We were looking for regaining control of some of the services. We were insourcing some of the previously outsourced services and changing the scope compared to the previous outsourcing agreement."
"We prepare the 20/20 vision, and our objective is to bring the capability for the group to be able to follow[emdash]notably the cloud-ification of Schneider[emdash]because Schneider is a legal proprietor on the IT, and we wanted a very good partner to be able to develop the business."
"We have an outsourced environment today, and the contract was and is expiring, so we chose to go out for a competitive tender for the resourcing of our current contract."
"Mercator as a company has been created as a private equity buyout from Emirates airline, and as such, we are relocating all of the IT and assets out from Emirates airline to our own environments. As part of that, I was brought in to establish new data center environments and internal infrastructure so the company could run standalone away from the Emirates environment."
"In its simplest form, it was a vitality exercise. Our contract with HP had first been signed in 1997, and we had continued that relationship with HP over about 17 years through a series of contract extensions. However, at this point, we felt that we had reached a point where we really couldnt enter into another contract extension with HP. It was time to renew the relationship and renew the agreement. HP had done well over those years; otherwise we wouldnt have stayed with them that long. However, we felt that a procurement exercise was due. Now when I say it was a vitality exercise, thats true, but it also gave us the opportunity to make ourselves more audit compliant. There were some things about the older infrastructure that fell short of our audit requirements, so that was an opportunity to fix that up. Also, of course, it was an opportunity to introduce some innovative new services, so it addressed our innovation objectives as well."
"It was just that Aimia as a company has grown through acquisitions, and we came to a point where the infrastructure that we supported required some streamlining. We operate in all four global regions, so Asia-Pacific, Europe, Canada, and the US. We have four regions and we have 42 data centers thanks to the number of acquisitions we made. The plan is to streamline these. We were also looking for a strategic partner that would help us innovate, help us with best-of-breed processes. Were a loyalty and marketing company highly leveraged by technology, so we wanted to ensure that we picked a good partner that would help us in our journey forward."
"We had it in the past. Most of the service for our CPD is already in our sourcing, but we were using several contracts with different providers, so it was very tough to manage the relationships between all the contracts. What we wanted with this contract was to consolidate all the services into only one provider, to probably get the best cost deal to the synergies between the different contracts, and due to the volume, reducing the volume to give us the best prices for the services. It was also to reduce the complexity and the time we needed to manage all the ecosystems of design providers regarding the CPD. We had the CPD outsourced, and we had the contract for the housing. We had a contract for the system administration. We had a contract for communications. We had several contracts. In the past, we also had all the infrastructure that was owned by Correos. We made a conversion in all the hardware systems, and with this contract we avoided doing investments for the future. We wanted this service model in which is also included investments. We needed also with this contract to renew all of our infrastructure. It was the time to decide to consolidate because we had to face up the renewal of most of all the infrastructure in the CPDs."
"The salesperson said that this bid process is referred to as Rabbit. Is that correct?[return]Right. Yes.[return][return]Can you give me the background on the business needs that prompted this purchase process?[return]There were two principle needs. The first one was a need to transform our current infrastructure platform to a refreshed or renewed technology platform, which leads to a number of value propositions toward our customers. The second was the need for a lower operating cost structure. It is our view that both of those objectives were targeted by the process."
"It was a separation between two companies, and we need to build up the infrastructure and location to host the systems which should be separated."
"HP actually hosts our SAP environment now for one of our business units, and we are doing a large expansion of our SAP environment across an entire division. The original contract with HP was actually transferred from an acquisition, and it was expiring. We went to HP directly to try to get them to extend the contract and to keep the terms similar. They tried to double the price and do all kinds of other nasty things to us. That forced us to go to bid."
"We are implementing the SAP application systems across our chemicals business. We had a SAP hosting agreement with HP that expires in January of 2016."
"Weve had a long-term partnership with HP. Actually since 1999 theyve been taking care of this contract, and the reason behind the sourcing now was actually the contract with HP ends in February 2016. Apart from that I will also say that we are looking for a  more proactive and more strategic-oriented partner which also could cover more of the application development, application maintenance areas and not just being part of a contract agreement with HP so far. We have a replacement for the work that has been done by HP for us. Also, we want a more strategic partner where we want to increase the footprint and make sure we have a partner which can help us out both in innovation and capacity within different areas, could be infrastructure, but also applications."
"Was this a replacement of an existing service provider?[return]No, we are developing it from the beginning. We did not have a solution in Internet banking. We are a little company[emdash]a credit cooperative[emdash]and we do not have Internet banking yet. This will be the first provision of this service.[return][return]Why did you decide that you wanted Internet banking? Was that a strategic objective?[return]Its the mobile explosion of using it, mainly from the young people. Our clients started to discuss this lack as a comparative; they discussed this as a freedom, as a democracy-like banking. They discussed, they defined, and the need came to IT to have solutions for that. Two years ago, this began to be a priority; so we started to manage the solutioning six or seven months ago."
"Actually, its for our entire outsourcing service. We have outsourced our credit card system to HP for about twenty years now. We have always had a need for this outsourcing service. At this time, we were trying to see if there are better vendors for the same service in the market."
"The company historically has been observing the IT as a cost and it had significantly kept the core investments very, very low for, I would say, eight to ten years. About eight years back the company went for implementing SAP and after that it has not leveraged that for me, and also has gone beyond in various other facets of leveraging IT capability of operation supply chain or digital business intelligence. As a result the company is lagging very significantly with respect to its deals in the e-marketplace. There is a huge amount of catch-up which needs to be done in the company, from establishing the very basics to be in order. The entire vision to realize is we have set forth about 80-odd projects over the next five or six years, and for all of that infrastructure is the foundation. If you are to ask me how the last one and a half, two years since Ive moved into this company, there has been a huge amount of effort in changing the mindset of the board from looking at IT as a cost[emdash]instead of looking at IT as a cost to look at it as an investment opportunity[emdash]and make them realize that it has huge return on investment capability. This is one of the very basic essential foundations for the road map was to begin in terms of infrastructure. This is one first and very significant step in the direction of realizing the companys vision."
"The costs, the delivery model, and the service quality were all not to our happiness. The contract ended, so we did not prolong the contract. We definitely started looking for a new, more modern, flexible, cost-effective, high-quality service provider.[return][return]Who was the incumbent provider?[return]Im too sure whether I am allowed to disclose that one."
"The trigger was to increase the SLAs and the quality of service that we have currently. Another trigger was the provisioning. Its supposed to be easier: the provisioning[emdash]and the costs are good for us also.[return][return]Before you even started looking at other vendors, you were looking for savings.[return]Yes, we tried to compare all. One factor was the support and maintenance. The support and maintenance right now is provided by HP from Spain for that infrastructure, so HP has a greater knowledge of our needs than the others. It was easier to decide.[return][return]So you needed better knowledge, efficiency, and cost savings. Was there an advantage on cost with HP, or were they all close?[return]No. It was close but when we evaluated the technical side and cost of change, HP definitely is better because the cost of change for the others will be very higher[emdash]and for us also."
"Procurement Consultant: Link Group acquired Superpartners last year and essentially, as an organization, has increased in size significantly. This is an opportunity with obviously now multiple suppliers, and this is an opportunity to consolidate in terms of supply. That was the main driver.[return][return]You said that you were looking at consolidating or if that didnt work out you would have a couple of providers. Did you end up being able to consolidate to one, or did you end up choosing a couple?[return]Procurement Consultant: At the end we decided to go with one supplier[emdash]one managed service provider. Theres a lot of efficiency you gain from that, by dealing with one supplier as opposed to many, and we were comfortable that the supplier we selected had the skills and experience we required across those towers, except for one tower which we carved out. Then that one we are still in the process of negotiation in terms of utilizing a specialist provider. Theres one area that we werent comfortable that the preferred respondent had that extra skill set. In fact HP never even responded on that tower, so it is a very specialist area and were still in the process of negotiating that tower. I wont go into detail with that because its still very sensitive and confidential."
"Prior to the bid process, we had HP delivering infrastructure services to us, which is everything up to the operating system. We had TCS, IBM, and Ericssons own service company called BUGS[emdash]which is an unfortunate acronym for an IT company, but its Business Unit Global Services[emdash]and the contracts were coming to an end. So, we wanted to re-contract for these services, and we only brought our incumbent vendors into the bidding.[return]     At the same time, we wanted to make some improvements to the services themselves and to transform how we did certain things; for example, in the HP case, moving much more to a cloud-based infrastructure. We wanted to push more responsibility and accountability over to our suppliers. Some of the things that we are currently doing internally from a technical design standpoint, etc., we wanted to push over to the suppliers and put more responsibility and accountability on them.[return]     Then of course there was cost cutting, to be honest. We needed to drive down our costs, and so what we did through this process was basically say to our suppliers, Look, these are our financial goals. Get creative and tell us, based on your best practices and what you know about us, the best way to do this. From an Ericsson standpoint, it was quite different than how it had been done in the past. In the past it was like Ericsson would put out an RFP and say, This is what we want you to do. Comply, no comply, and give us our price. In this case we said, Look, these are our objectives. Tell us what you think the best way to achieve those objectives is."
"For us, it was two things. (1) We had a need to refresh our existing infrastructure in this space; it was dated, and so we needed to make an investment. (2) We wanted to make more than just a like-for-like replacement; we wanted a significant upgrade in the capabilities we had around this technology to be able to deal with emerging threats and advanced capabilities."
"We already ran an RFP for security analytics three or four years ago, and it was then that we actually selected HP. The security service provided by HP was not really to our satisfaction, so we have reopened an RFP because sometimes that shakes the tree a little bit and might change some of the issues we have been faced with. During the RFP process, HP has not really shown an improvement; they didnt really understand what we were looking for. They were short-listed, though, down to the end. We had two participants left[emdash]HP and BT[emdash]but we ultimately selected BT. Now we are migrating the existing service over from HP to BT.[return]    HP products have been kept[emdash]ArcSight and TippingPoint[emdash]so we continue to purchase those from HP. It was mainly driven by or related to the managed service HP has provided, with which we were not really satisfied."
"We initiated this back in 2011, actually, because there is a gap in security monitoring; so we decided to explore something. We started with a very small scope. We implemented from 2011 up to 2013-2014. In 2013 we decided to run an RFP to see if we wanted to continue with the same vendor or to go for a different vendor as an expanded solution."
"The bid is for some security services?[return]Yes.[return][return]What prompted this bid process in the first place?[return]That was an evolution of the threat landscape and our capabilities to deal with that internally."
"We had some services running with HP in terms of security monitoring. We initially were going to grow that scope with HP; but we were dissatisfied with the service that we were getting, so we decided to run an RFP. Instead of going straight to HP, we said, We want to see what else is out there and make sure that we select the best vendor for our services. We informed HP of this; and as we ran through this new RFP, we had been working internally with HP to try to improve the service that they were currently providing.[return][return]Answered subsequently. [We got forced to run a new RFP because we were dissatisfied with the service and couldnt get any significant improvement from HP.][return][return]HP was in there, and BT. Did you consider looking at any other vendors?[return]Yes. The two I mentioned were the finalists. We looked at six or seven different providers and then, as we progressed with the RFP, further reduced that. Again, we have got to recognize that with HP, there really were two dimensions: the technology and the service. We were looking at this as a bundle. Overall, considering that HP has pretty mature technology, this allowed them to move into one of the two finalist spots."
"There were two things: (1) our current technology was out-of-date and going on end-of-life, and (2) we knew that the current method for handling it was inadequate for our needs[emdash]for doing cybersecurity in general."
"The Coca-Cola Company, like most companies, is ever changing.  We have new needs. There are products weve used that we have to replace with  newer products that can do what we need to do. With that comes a support  team that has the knowledge and capability to support it. Thats  first and foremost[emdash]the knowledge level of the support team for the  vendor in question[emdash]to make sure they have the required resources  to be able to handle the support. [return]    Typically, people like me go  in and first see how the support model needs to work and whats required  of the team. Once Ive got that set up, I usually work with the  engagement teams with that vendor. I may not be the manager of the  support teams, but Im the liaison that works to make sure the model is  put in place correctly. Im not sure what the titles are for these people, but we basically make sure that the support  teams have all the documentation that they need in place, that the team  is fully trained to support that application in our environment, and  things of that nature. Its really important that the  support team has the capacity and the knowledge and can provide the  support correctly."
"Was there any kind of transition on this project--from another vendor to HP, or from in-house to outsourcing?[return]No,  this is totally a new sort of product were introducing in our  infrastructure. This is a service we didnt have before that were just  bolting onto our internal infrastructure.[return][return]What prompted the need for these new services?[return]Its just the industry and the technologies that are moving in that direction, where we needed to have a good product to look for the security enhancements. We need tablets, in particular[emdash]project and product.[return][return]Is this for a new product of yours, or just to expand your security capabilities?[return]A bit of both. Its a new product, so we need to expand our existing capabilities.[return][return]As well?[return]Yes.[return][return]In what way are you expanding? What will these services do for you?[return]Theyre going to give an H-rated view of what is happening within our infrastructure in terms of security. Apparently, we have a disparate system all on its own, giving us different information, whereas this one is going to give us a complete overview."
"Answered subsequently. [The reason we did this was to do with implementation of PSN nationally. Thats a technical requirement going forth for all data and voice networks. What we needed was consulting services to come and do a health test on all of our systems here, and our policies. Se we scored the marketplace. There werent many companies out there with PSN experience; and when we had the invitations come back, obviously HP came back with the best experience in that kind of area.]"
"This work, as I stated before, is primarily in support of our work which weve got to do for the new government secure and connection to the Public Services Network, so its in support of an overall project thats essentially a system that the government agencies and bodies use to be able to interconnect with each other and be able to talk to each other on a secure platform. So its in support of that work, which we are currently doing and still continuing to do."
"My IT security operations team[emdash]theyre in-house[emdash]is responsible for managing all of our firewalls, remote access devices, URL filtering[emdash]basically, protecting the edge of the Cenovus network to the internet, so all our routers, firewalls, and stuff that connect to the internet. That team works regular work hours, and then they have an on-call rotation. Several years ago, back in 2011, right around the time when we outsourced to HP, I wanted to test out a security operation center for basically 24/7 monitoring. In other words, I wanted to augment our support after hours so that, rather than having things blow up and a client log a ticket two hours later: The internets down; how come I cant connect? Then they log a ticket, and our people eventually get called out, three hours after the fact, and then find out that it was a link that was congested due to a virus outbreak thats been rampant through our environment. I was thinking that if we had somebody monitoring it 24/7 and actually looking at our CIM, we could take action a lot quicker. That was the gist behind a security operation center.[return]     I did actually go to market with a potential provider back in 2011, just to try them out; and then, shortly thereafter[emdash]about a year after[emdash]I lost that portfolio through a reorg, or a reshuffle of accountabilities. When I came back over nine months ago, it turned out that we still had that same outsourced company doing our 24/7 monitoring. They werent providing any value to us. Basically, we were paying them on a monthly basis and getting nothing in return[emdash]or what I perceived as nothing[emdash]no value. In discussion with both my team and our technical security team, which isnt in my area, we decided that it was still an important service and that we should go to market for it. I canceled the contract, gave the service provider that we had notice, and canceled the service outright with the idea that wed go to the RFP to find a new provider. Thats when HP came in. They participated in that RFP with five other vendors, then we shortlisted down to three, and then we made our choice.[return]     I still have an in-house IT security operations team. Theres still the technical security team thats responsible for our CIM environment, but just like my IT security operations, theyre not 24/7; theyre not monitoring the environment all the time. So that was the reason for the RFP, because we wanted to have the 24/7 monitoring and wanted people to be able to look at and see the events real time, or as they occur; be able to do some evaluation; and determine if we need to call anybody out to do stuff[emdash]with also the potential that in a year or two, as the service matures, they might even get more access to our equipment, if we deem it wise. Thats long-winded, but thats the gist of it."
"This should be in regard to RFP that we issued for a managed security provider.[return][return]Monitoring security services, yes.[return]Some monitoring services, thats correct. We were looking for after-hours coverage for one of our primary security tools. We have 24/7 on-call support, but we dont have anybody who actually monitors our systems after hours. So we wanted to make sure that we had an organization working with us to be able to monitor and action alerts, should they come in during the evening hours."
"It was the intention to provide our lab community with a means to do a vulnerability scanning of their labs to see if they were secure enough, if there were not any unnecessary open ports, if they are not using the default password, if they are using secure protocols, etc. What we have done, then, is to look first at a tool that could do that for us. Secondly, after we selected the tool, we also started looking at a managed service provider, because not all the labs want to spend the time in analyzing all this vulnerability data; and besides not having the time, some lab owners simply dont have the expertise to analyze the results from the scanning and propose remediation action for it. Therefore, we started looking into a provider that could do that for us, that could deliver that service toward the lab community; and thats the reason, actually, why we did the bid. What we did then was[emdash]there was first a selection. Now, I have to admit I was not in the project from the very beginning, but I started doing the project when we were already in the POC phase. That was done solely with the help of the HP team, which was one of the candidates to be, then, also the managed service provider. Then we did a pilot with the only two candidates that were left, and they were Accenture and HP. There were also other ones, but they were not selected for several reasons[emdash]could be cost, but I dont really know the details on that."
"We are actually rolling out a vulnerability management project. The driver for this vulnerability project management project is that we currently dont have a centralized program for that in place, which is a gap which were trying to fill. We have selected a tool for that; but we do not just want to throw a tool to the people who are actually responsible for those assets that we are going to scan for vulnerability. Thats why we also decided to actually add a managed service on top of that tool who can actually provide a service for that tool at the level which fits the experience and the time and resources that those other teams have. So we have sent out an RFP for this[emdash]what we call, the vulnerability management managed service[emdash]with three service levels: basic, silver, gold. At the gold level, the managed service would basically be taking over the full vulnerability management service and do all the vulnerability scanning and reporting on behalf of the team responsible for those IT assets. On the other hand, we have a basic support level, where actually the team itself does most of the technical activities; but still the managed service provider is there to support them whenever they have a question or a problem and to provide training and things like that."
"The topic is that the amount of publications in the press and also the occurrence of threats to the generation area increased over the last year. Therefore, a security program to optimize our capabilities here was launched. If you say what was really the one event, I would go a little bit into the past and say it was TaxNet[emdash]the threat for the generation part."
"In 2013, together with HP Enterprise Services, we did an IT security maturity assessment. It turned out that, for several reasons, we did not invest in IT security for quite some while. The decision was taken to invest in IT security, and this is why the security improvement program Im currently looking after was kicked off."
"We already had the managed security services from another HRIS competitor. Its called Wipro. [We wanted] the ability of this IT outsourcing of some of the securities operations to a partner. So a number of vendors competed, in that they were security-ranked monitoring and management. Then we have security devices, so management of those security devices and risk management and risk monitoring and [indecipherable 2:29] and so on and so forth."
"It was the result of a KPMG audit which determined that our secure development standards were almost non-existent, and that risk was raised internally. It got visibility, and the CIO determined that we had to remediate, so that was the initiating action."
"I came into this organization and saw some gaps between the existing service that we have and where we need to be from a monitoring and SOC response standpoint."
"Improve our security capabilities; improve our digital security capabilities and products.[return][return]Was there anything in particular, any changes that had occurred recently that caused that? Or was this something that was just on your agenda this year?[return]No. Strategic agenda to improve the capabilities; and this is one of the many tools that we were looking for."
"The business drivers mainly were from a risk and compliance perspective. The current service does not meet the requirements Philips has in the area of the compliance, risk management, and also security. Examples are that there are specific regulations[emdash]for instance, SOCS and HIPPA[emdash]which stipulate that you need to verify users from time to time to see what entitlements and rights they have in their systems, and at Philips with the current solution, it was difficult to assess. For onboarding of users, its a bit technical, but if somebody within Philips is leaving the firm and starts working for a competitor and is not properly offboarded the Philips IT landscape, then the potential risk is that this person could still access cloud applications, such as in Salesforce, and see all sorts of things beneficial for a competitor. So we needed to have a process implemented that would mitigate the associated risks. There were some open audit points in the area of identity management, so they needed to address that. Im not going to speak about specifics here, but there were audit points. The current process is labor intensive and involved a lot of manual work, and we wanted to augment that.[return][return]Who was your provider for those services?[return]For the current services, the provider is Atos in the Netherlands. The technology is Microsofts Forefront Identity Manager."
"We basically had a Legacy Identity and Access Management that did not provide the functionality and the security we needed anymore, so we needed a more future proof solution.[return][return]Was providing it as a service part of the plan from the start then? To also have it serviced outside?[return]Yes."
